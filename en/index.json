Interleaving String\nGiven strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.\nAn interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:\ns = s1 + s2 + . . . + sn t = t1 + t2 + . . . + tm |n - m| \u0026lt;= 1 The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + . . . or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + . . .

Preface Originally, I was required to create a web service for a research project, but I accidentally discovered Hugo. So I took this opportunity to use Hugo to make my blog. This article mainly covers the process of setting up a personal blog, some of the problems I encountered and the solutions, I hope it will be helpful to you.\nSince I am using mac os, there may be some differences from the Windows system.\n2. Hugo 2.1 Hugo installation First, use the terminal to install Hugo.\nbrew install hugo Homebrew is a special tool for mac os, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t have brew, you need to install homebrew (mac os) in advance.\n2.2 Use Hugo to create a simple blog First, use the following command to create a new folder for Hugo.\nhugo new site foldername foldername fill in any name you like. Note that all future operations need to be performed under this path. After the creation is successful, go to the path and you will find 9 folders.\narchetypes\nThis folder only has a default.md file, which only contains the header. Its main function is that every time a new md file is created, it will be created according to the default format set in this file. +++ title = \u0026#39;{{ replace .File.ContentBaseName “-” “ ‘ | title }}’ # File name when created date = {{ .Date }} # Current date and time draft = true # Whether it is a draft +++ The following code is a method for creating a new md file in Hugo. The blog is customized in it, and after the creation is successful, the title in the above code will become blog.\nhugo new blog.md content The folder is empty and needs to be added by the user. For example, if you want to have a section about learning in your blog, you can create a folder called learning in this folder. hugo.toml This file is the Hugo configuration file and is very important. Since the toml syntax is more troublesome, and most of the information found is to convert the toml file to a yaml file, it is recommended to use a configuration file in yaml format. Details will be provided later. layouts\nThis folder is empty before a theme is added. After a theme is added, it mostly contains html files that are used to display various pages. themes\nThis folder is saved in this folder after adding the theme, and usually no changes need to be made. assets\nUsed to store css files. data\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t used it and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what it does. i18n\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t used it either. static\nThis folder can be used to store images. The above is an introduction to the relevant files. There is no need to remember them carefully, and you can come back later if necessary.\nNext, set the theme. Go to Hugo Themes and choose a theme you like. The theme I chose is PaperMod, the first theme on the website. Note that the configuration files for each theme are different, so you need to check the documentation for that theme in detail. After choosing your favorite theme, the word download will appear. Click download to go to the GitHub interface. Copy the GitHub address and enter the following code in the terminal:\ngit clone theme_address Replace theme_address with the GitHub address you copied.\nAfter the download is successful, you will find a new folder under your root folder. For example, after the PaperMod download is successful, a folder named hugo-PaperMod will appear. Move the entire folder to the themes folder. After that, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything with the themes folder. Then add the following content to your configuration file, which is the hugo.toml file.\ntheme = \u0026#39;theme_name\u0026#39; #theme = \u0026#39;hugo-PaperMod\u0026#39; The yaml syntax is as follows:\ntheme: theme_name #theme: hugo-PaperMod If you are using the PaperMod theme, I recommend referring to hugo博客搭建 | PaperMod主题 for configuration file settings. Including related operations in the content folder, you can also refer to the above link, which is very clear.\n2.3 Hugo startup Hugo has two startup methods.\nhugo server hugo server -D Both commands can start the blog. After successful startup, copy the URL prompted to access the blog locally. The difference between the two commands is whether to display the md file with the header filedraft: true or not. hugo server cannot display files with the draft: true, so you need to be aware of this. Therefore, you can change the set to false in the default file, which will make things a bit easier. But if you create some files that do not want anyone to see that, then you can set draft: true(I strongly recommend this).\nAfter completing the above in order, you can use Hugo to complete your own static blog. In addition to the above links, you can also refer to the content of this blog Hugo + PaperMod to build a technical blog.\n2.4 Problems and Solutions 2.4.1 Multilingual In the configuration file “hugo.yaml”, you can configure multiple languages. For example, my configuration file has both Chinese and English.\nlanguages: en: languageName: “English” contentDir: content/English weight: 1 profileMode: enabled: true title: Gary\u0026#39;s House subtitle: ”It\u0026#39;s happy to see you!” imageUrl: “img/me.jpg” #The image is stored in static/img/me.gif imageTitle: imageWidth: 150 imageHeight: 150 buttons: - name: 🧑‍💻Tech url: posts/tech ... zh: languageName: “Chinese” contentDir: content/Chinese weight: 1 profileMode: enabled: true title: Gary\u0026#39;s House subtitle: “Nice to meet you!” imageUrl: ‘img/me.jpg’ #The image is stored in static/img/me.gif imageTitle: imageWidth: 150 imageHeight: 150 buttons: - name: 🧑‍💻技术 url: posts/tech/ ... In order to be multilingual, you need to create multiple folders under the content folder to store the content. I created two folders, English and Chinese in the content folder. Then place the multilingual files in their own folders.\n2.4.2 Search page The main function of the search page is to provide an internal search. The PaperMod theme provides search.html, so we only need to do two things.\nCreate search.md in the same path as the posts folder and change the content of the header file. +++ title = “Search” draft = false layout = ”search” +++ Then add the setting to the configuration file hugo.yaml. - identifier: search name: 🔍Search url: search weight: 1 identifier and name can be changed to your liking, but url must be set in search.\nReplenishment: If you want to display the current time on the search page, you need to go to layouts/_default/search.html. Add the following content to line 6 of your own search.html file to display the time on the search interface.\n\u0026lt;header class=“page-header”\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{- (printf “%s\u0026amp;nbsp;” .Title ) | htmlUnescape -}} ... \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=“post-date”\u0026gt;{{ now.Format “2006-01-02” }}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 3. GitHub Pages deployment 3.1 Preliminary preparations First, you need to log in to your GitHub account and create two repositories. One is a private repository with a custom name, mine is my_blog, and the other is a public repository with the name username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username. This repository is mainly used to update and display blog content. You can add a readme file with any content when creating the repository. Follow the steps below for the public repository. Remember to upload content to the master branch.\n3.2 Uploading local files to a GitHub private repository Refer to the article Uploading files to GitHub via the terminal to upload files to a GitHub repository.\nFirst go to the root path of Hugo (the folder contains all Hugo files), and then upload the files in the following order.\ngit init git add . git commit -m “comment” git remote rm origin git remote add origin private_repository_url git push origin master The above operation should successfully upload all files to the private repository.\nThe errors I encountered and the solutions:\nThe source reference specification master does not match. git branch -M master Changes not yet staged for commit: modify not yet added to commit (use “git add” and/or “git commit -a”). git add --all git commit -m “comment” git remote rm origin git remote add origin private_repository_url git push origin master 3.3 Upload the local public files to the GitHub public repository. First, the name of the public repository must be username.github.io. The main process for uploading is:\nCreate a public folder in the root folder of the local Hugo. hugo -F --cleanDestinationDir Clone the GitHub public repository to the root path of this hugo, and add all files in public and hugo.yaml (very important!) to the local repository. git clone public_repository_url cp hugo.yaml username.github.io/ mv public/* username.github.io/ cd username.github.io Upload the local repository to GitHub git add . git commit -m “rebuild_site $(date)” git push origin master The above is the process for the first upload. Subsequent uploads can be automated by executing the script. After completing the above, you can run Hugo locally and try it with the address username.github.io. If it is successful, it proves to be feasible.\nSet up a script file to facilitate updating content each time. The script file can be saved in the root folder of Hugo with any name. Mine is `issue.sh'. hugo -F --cleanDestinationDir cp hugo.yaml public/ rm -rf username.github.io/* mv public/* username.github.io/ rm -rf public cd username.github.io/ git add . git commit -m “rebuild_site $(date)” git push -u origin +master All the above username.github.io needs to be replaced with your own public repository name. The ssh file is executed as follows:\n./issue.sh If the above is successfully completed, you can proceed to deploy GitHub Actions.\n3.4 GitHub Actions deployment This deployment is mainly to allow the static blog to be accessed by others, and is deployed on the GitHub website.\nGenerate a token First, you need to set a key. Go to your personal homepage, click Settings, then find Developer Settings at the bottom left, and follow the instructions on the page. Click generate token to create a key and must remember the token that starts with ghp_.\nAdd token Next, add the token you just got to the location shown below. The name can be MY_BLOG. Add workflows First, make sure that the current branch is master. Then, execute the following steps in the order shown below to generate a hugo.yml file. The content of the hugo.yml file is as follows:\nname: pages-auto-build-deploy on: # workflow_dispatch: push: branches: - main jobs: build-and-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.130.0\u0026#39; #You need to change this according to your own Hugo version. You can view the version with the command hugo version. extended: true #Determined based on the query result of hugo version. - name: Build Hugo run: hugo - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: GitHub_token: ${{ secrets.MY_BLOG }} # MY_BLOG is the token name just added publish_dir: ./public commit_message: ${{ GitHub.event.head_commit.message }} After completing all the above operations, you can go to GitHub\u0026rsquo;s top and click Actions to check whether the workflow has been started successfully. After a successful startup, anyone can directly access your blog using username.github.io.\nReference links I am kind of stupid, so I have only completed the basic settings of my blog after referring to the blogs and articles of many great bloggers. You can refer to the following links for a lot of additional content.\nHugo blog setup | PaperMod theme Hugo + PaperMod setup technical blog Deploying a hugo blog to github Hugo+Github Pages+Github Action blog plan 3 – Configuring Github Action to enable automatic publishing ","permalink":"https://garywy.github.io/en/posts/tech/hugo_githubpages/","summary":"1.
