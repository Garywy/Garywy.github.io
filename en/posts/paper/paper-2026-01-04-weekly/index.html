We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \\emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \\emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \\emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \\emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \\emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.\n📄 Download PDF\nPractising responsibility: Ethics in NLP as a hands-on course Authors: Malvina Nissim, Viviana Patti, Beatrice Savoldi Venue: arXiv (2025)\nAs Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field’s rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and “learning by teaching” methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.\n📄 Download PDF\nUncertainty-aware Semi-supervised Ensemble Teacher Framework for Multilingual Depression Detection Authors: Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman, Velpuru Navya, Sanskar, Shuja Uddin Qureshi, Nagendra Kumar Venue: arXiv (2025)\nDetecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.\n📄 Download PDF\nChat-Driven Optimal Management for Virtual Network Services Authors: Yuya Miyaoka, Masaki Inoue, Kengo Urata, Shigeaki Harada Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThis paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.\n📄 Download PDF\nSafe in the Future, Dangerous in the Past: Dissecting Temporal and Linguistic Vulnerabilities in LLMs Authors: Muhammad Abdullahi Said, Muhammad Sammani Sani Venue: arXiv (2025)\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.\n📄 Download PDF\nFinMMDocR: Benchmarking Financial Multimodal Reasoning with Scenario Awareness, Document Understanding, and Multi-Step Computation Authors: Zichen Tang, Haihong E, Rongjin Li, Jiacheng Liu, Linwei Jia, Zhuodi Hao, Zhongjun Yang, Yuanze Li, Haolin Tian, Xinyi Hu, Peizhi Zhao, Yuan Liu, Zhengyu Wang, Xianghe Wang, Yiling Huang, Xueyuan Lin, Ruofei Bai, Zijian Xie, Qian Huang, Ruining Cao, Haocheng Gao Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.\n📄 Download PDF\nDocument Data Matching for Blockchain-Supported Real Estate Authors: Henrique Lin, Tiago Dias, Miguel Correia Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to streamline real estate transactions, strengthen stakeholder trust, and enable scalable, secure digital processes.\n📄 Download PDF\nAutomating the Analysis of Parsing Algorithms (and other Dynamic Programs) Authors: Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell, Jason Eisner Venue: arXiv (2025)\nMuch algorithmic research in NLP aims to efficiently manipulate rich formal structures. An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm – for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size. They may also wish to determine the necessary properties of the quantities derived by the algorithm to synthesize efficient data structures and verify type errors. In this paper, we develop a system for helping programmers to perform these types of analyses. We apply our system to a number of NLP algorithms and find that it successfully infers types, dead and redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity bounds.\n📄 Download PDF\nPhyGDPO: Physics-Aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization for Physically Consistent Text-to-Video Generation Authors: Yuanhao Cai, Kunpeng Li, Menglin Jia, Jialiang Wang, Junzhe Sun, Feng Liang, Weifeng Chen, Felix Juefei-Xu, Chu Wang, Ali Thabet, Xiaoliang Dai, Xuan Ju, Alan Yuille, Ji Hou Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRecent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2. Please check our project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/PhyGDPO for more video results.

Kim Venue: arXiv (2025)\nDeveloping space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.\n📄 Download PDF\nUnderstanding EFL Learners’ Code-Switching and Teachers’ Pedagogical Approaches in LLM-Supported Speaking Practice Authors: Junyeong Park, Jieun Han, Yeon Su Park, Youngbin Lee, Suin Kim, Juho Kim, Alice Oh, So-Yeon Ahn Venue: arXiv (2025)\nFor English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, code-switching (CSW), or alternating between their native language and the target language (English), can lower anxiety and ease communication barriers. Large language models (LLMs), with their multilingual abilities, offer new opportunities to support CSW in speaking practice. Yet, the pedagogical design of LLM-based tutors remains underexplored. To this end, we conducted a six-week study of LLM-mediated speaking practice with 20 Korean EFL learners, alongside a qualitative study with nine English teachers who designed and refined responses to learner CSW. Findings show that learners used CSW not only to bridge lexical gaps but also to express cultural and emotional nuance, prompting teachers to employ selective interventions and dynamic scaffolding strategies. We conclude with design implications for bilingual LLM-powered tutors that leverage teachers’ expertise to transform CSW into meaningful learning opportunities.\n📄 Download PDF\nTabiBERT: A Large-Scale ModernBERT Foundation Model and Unified Benchmarking Framework for Turkish Authors: Melikşah Türker, A. Ebrar Kızıloğlu, Onur Güngör, Susan Üsküdarlı Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSince the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.\n📄 Download PDF\nScaling Open-Ended Reasoning to Predict the Future Authors: Nikhil Chandak, Shashwat Goel, Ameya Prabhu, Moritz Hardt, Jonas Geiping Venue: arXiv (2025)\nHigh-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.\n📄 Download PDF\nVulcan: Instance-Optimal Systems Heuristics Through LLM-Driven Search Authors: Rohit Dwivedula, Divyanshu Saxena, Sujay Yadalam, Daehyeok Kim, Aditya Akella Venue: arXiv (2025)\nResource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments. We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics – specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed – using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code. We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.\n📄 Download PDF\nMany Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence Authors: Diji Yang, Yi Zhang Venue: arXiv (2025)\nDespite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights. B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.\n📄 Download PDF\nContext-aware LLM-based AI Agents for Human-centered Energy Management Systems in Smart Buildings Authors: Tianzhi He, Farrokh Jazizadeh Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThis study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype’s performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.\n📄 Download PDF\nAdaGReS:Adaptive Greedy Context Selection via Redundancy-Aware Scoring for Token-Budgeted RAG Authors: Chao Peng, Bin Wang, Zhilei Long, Jinfang Sheng Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.\n📄 Download PDF\nModeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts Authors: Nasim Borazjanizadeh, James McClelland Venue: arXiv (2025)\nTransformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level “thought” states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG’s loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.\n📄 Download PDF\nEF(X) Orientations: A Parameterized Complexity Perspective Authors: Sotiris Kanellopoulos, Edouard Nemery, Christos Pergaminelis, Minas Marios Sotiriou, Manolis Vasilakis Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe concept of fair orientations in graphs was introduced by Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa in 2023, naturally modeling fair division scenarios in which resources are only contested by neighbors. In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations.

Erera Venue: arXiv (2025)\nMulticommodity capacitated network design (MCND) models can be used to optimize the consolidation of shipments within e-commerce fulfillment networks. In practice, fulfillment networks require that shipments with the same origin and destination follow the same transfer path. This unsplittable flow requirement complicates the MCND problem, requiring integer programming (IP) formulations in which binary variables replace continuous flow variables. To enhance the solvability of this variant of the MCND problem for large-scale logistics networks, this work focuses on strengthening dual bounds. We investigate the polyhedra of arc-set relaxations, and we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities that can be implemented within solution approaches. We develop one approach that dynamically adds valid inequalities to the root node of a reformulation of the MCND IP with additional valid metric inequalities. We show the effectiveness of our ideas with a comprehensive computational study using path-based fulfillment instances, constructed from data provided by a large U.S.-based e-commerce company, and the well-known arc-based Canad instances. Experiments show that our best solution approach for a practical path-based model reduces the IP gap by an average of 26.5% and 22.5% for the two largest instance groups, compared to solving the reformulation alone, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the dual bound. In addition, experiments using only the arc-based relaxation highlight the strength of our new valid inequalities relative to the linear programming relaxation (LPR), yielding an IP-gap reduction of more than 85%.\n📄 Download PDF\nAttribution-Guided Distillation of Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders Authors: Cristina P. Martin-Linares, Jonathan P. Ling Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature’s contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels\n📄 Download PDF\nHigh-performance quantum interconnect between bosonic modules beyond transmission loss constraints Authors: Hongwei Huang, Jie Zhou, Weizhou Cai, Weiting Wang, Yilong Zhou, Yunlai Zhu, Ziyue Hua, Yifang Xu, Lida Sun, Juan Song, Tang Su, Ming Li, Haifeng Yu, Chang-Ling Zou, Luyan Sun Venue: arXiv (2025)\nDistributed quantum computing architectures require high-performance quantum interconnects between quantum information processing units, while previous implementations have been fundamentally limited by transmission line losses. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss interconnect between two superconducting modules using an aluminum coaxial cable, achieving a bus mode quality factor of 1.7e6. By employing SNAIL as couplers, we realize inter-modular state transfer in 0.8 μs via a three-wave mixing process. The state transfer fidelity reaches 98.2% for quantum states encoded in the first two energy levels, achieving a Bell state fidelity of 92.5%. Furthermore, we show the capability to transfer high-dimensional states by successfully transmitting binomially encoded logical states. Systematic characterization reveals that performance constraints have shifted from transmission line losses (contributing merely 0.2% infidelity) to module-channel interface effects and local Kerr nonlinearities. Our work advances the realization of quantum interconnects approaching fundamental capacity limits, paving the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and efficient quantum communications.\n📄 Download PDF\nCharacterization of Transfer Using Multi-task Learning Curves Authors: András Millinghoffer, Bence Bolgár, Péter Antal Venue: arXiv (2025)\nTransfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.\n📄 Download PDF\nLatent Twins: A Framework for Scene Recognition and Fast Radiative Transfer Inversion in FORUM All-Sky Observations Authors: Cristina Sgattoni, Luca Sgheri, Matthias Chung, Michele Martinazzo Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) mission will provide, for the first time, systematic far-infrared spectral measurements of Earth’s outgoing radiation, enabling improved understanding of atmospheric processes and the radiation budget. Retrieving atmospheric states from these observations constitutes a high-dimensional, ill-posed inverse problem, particularly under cloudy-sky conditions where multiple-scattering effects are present. In this work, we develop a data-driven, physics-aware inversion framework for FORUM all-sky retrievals based on latent twins: coupled autoencoders for atmospheric states and spectra, combined with bidirectional latent-space mappings. A lightweight model-consistency correction ensures physically plausible cloud variable reconstructions. The resulting framework demonstrates potential for retrievals of atmospheric, cloud and surface variables, providing information that can serve as a prior, initial guess, or surrogate for computationally expensive full-physics inversion methods. It also enables robust scene classification and near-instantaneous inference, making it suitable for operational near-real-time applications. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic FORUM-like data and discuss implications for future data assimilation and climate studies.\n📄 Download PDF\nEdit3r: Instant 3D Scene Editing from Sparse Unposed Images Authors: Jiageng Liu, Weijie Lyu, Xueting Li, Yejie Guo, Ming-Hsuan Yang Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.\n📄 Download PDF\nFrom Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing Authors: Xu He, Haoxian Zhang, Hejia Chen, Changyuan Zheng, Liyang Chen, Songlin Tang, Jiehui Huang, Xiaoqiang Liu, Pengfei Wan, Zhiyong Wu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nAudio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video’s lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject’s lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.\n📄 Download PDF\nComputational Analysis of Disease Progression in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Authors: Omar Said, Christopher Tossas-Betancourt, Mary K. Olive, Jimmy C. Lu, Adam Dorfman, C. Alberto Figueroa Venue: arXiv (2025)\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.\n📄 Download PDF\nNo Vision, No Wearables: 5G-based 2D Human Pose Recognition with Integrated Sensing and Communications Authors: Haojin Li, Dongzhe Li, Anbang Zhang, Wenqi Zhang, Chen Sun, Haijun Zhang Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWith the increasing maturity of contactless human pose recognition (HPR) technology, indoor interactive applications have raised higher demands for natural, controller-free interaction methods. However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction.\n📄 Download PDF\nBEDA: Belief Estimation as Probabilistic Constraints for Performing Strategic Dialogue Acts Authors: Hengli Li, Zhaoxin Yu, Qi Shen, Chenxi Li, Mengmeng Wang, Tinglang Wu, Yipeng Kang, Yuxuan Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng Venue: arXiv (2025)\nStrategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.\n📄 Download PDF\nDescription of Baryon Mass Spectrum by Open Strings and Diquarks Authors: Yuki Fujimoto Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe analyze the mass spectra of hadrons and demonstrate that the physical spectra of mesons and baryons are well described by the exponential spectrum of open strings. The open string spectrum, derived from string theory, is characterized by a unique Hagedorn temperature $T_{\\rm H}$ and free from any other parameters. Notably, our fitting to the physical spectra yields consistent values for both mesons and baryons, $T_{\\rm H} \\simeq 0.34,\\text{GeV}$, which contrasts with previous phenomenological analyses that suggested different values. This obtained value aligns well with typical string tension derived from lattice-QCD calculations and the Regge slope. In the baryonic sector, our results indicate that diquarks play a crucial role in describing the mass spectrum, implying that baryons can be understood as a quark-diquark system, as anticipated by Regge phenomenology. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of quark deconfinement, especially in the possibly existing regime at high temperature and small baryon chemical potential within the QCD phase diagram.\n📄 Download PDF\nBi-C2R: Bidirectional Continual Compatible Representation for Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification Authors: Zhenyu Cui, Jiahuan Zhou, Yuxin Peng Venue: arXiv (2025)\nLifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as “re-indexing”. However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.\n📄 Download PDF\nNoise resilient real-time phase imaging via undetected light Authors: Josué R. León-Torres, Patrick Hendra, Yugant Mukeshbhai Hadiyal, Christopher Spiess, Fabian Steinlechner, Frank Setzpfandt, Markus Gräfe, Valerio Flavio Gili Venue: arXiv (2025)\nQuantum imaging with undetected light has recently emerged as a technique in which quantum correlations and nonlinear interferometry are combined to decouple illumination and detection paths. This approach has been more recently extended and combined with digital phase-shifting holography and off-axis holography to extract both the amplitude and phase information of a sample relying on single-photon interference. Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where the observed system is subject to environmental noise and dynamic variations remains challenging. The primary limitation lies in the inability of quantum imaging systems to retrieve object information in real time under high-noise conditions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate real-time amplitude and phase imaging in noisy environments, building upon our previous implementation of quantum off-axis holography. Our results demonstrate real-time imaging at acquisition rates up to 4~Hz, even when the noise level exceeds the signal by an order of magnitude.\n📄 Download PDF\nGEQIE Framework for Rapid Quantum Image Encoding Authors: Rafał Potempa, Michał Kordasz, Józef P.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.\n📄 Download PDF\n🔍 linguistics SpaceTimePilot: Generative Rendering of Dynamic Scenes Across Space and Time Authors: Zhening Huang, Hyeonho Jeong, Xuelin Chen, Yulia Gryaditskaya, Tuanfeng Y. Wang, Joan Lasenby, Chun-Hao Huang Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video’s motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Rodriguez-Nieva Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRandomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions.\n📄 Download PDF\nGaMO: Geometry-aware Multi-view Diffusion Outpainting for Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction Authors: Yi-Chuan Huang, Hao-Jen Chien, Chin-Yang Lin, Ying-Huan Chen, Yu-Lun Liu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRecent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.\n📄 Download PDF\nFineTec: Fine-Grained Action Recognition Under Temporal Corruption via Skeleton Decomposition and Sequence Completion Authors: Dian Shao, Mingfei Shi, Like Liu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRecognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Zhu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSupersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.\n📄 Download PDF\nFluid dynamics as intersection problem Authors: Nikita Nekrasov, Paul Wiegmann Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe formulate the covariant hydrodynamics equations describing the fluid dynamics as the problem of intersection theory on the infinite dimensional symplectic manifold associated with spacetime.

We point out a five-dimensional origin of the formalism of Lichnerowicz and Carter. Our formalism also incorporates the chiral anomaly and Onsager quantization. We clarify the relation between the canonical velocity and Landau $4$-velocity, the meaning of Kelvin’s theorem.

Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities.\n📄 Download PDF\nResponseRank: Data-Efficient Reward Modeling through Preference Strength Learning Authors: Timo Kaufmann, Yannick Metz, Daniel Keim, Eyke Hüllermeier Venue: arXiv (2025)\nBinary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.\n📄 Download PDF\nStrong Gravitational Lensing by a Black Hole with a Global Monopole in Kalb-Ramond Bumblebee Gravity Authors: Bijendra Kumar Vishvakarma, Shubham Kala Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe investigate the strong gravitational lensing and shadow properties of the black hole in the context of bumblebee gravity, characterized by a global monopole charge $κη^2$ and a Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $γ$. We compute the deflection angles of light passing near the black hole in strong deflection limit, and estimate key lensing observables, including relativistic Einstein rings, absolute magnifications, image separations, and flux ratios, for astrophysical black holes. The black hole shadow is analyzed using the apparent angular size $θ_{\\rm Shadow} = 2,θ_{\\infty}$ in the limiting photon orbit. Furthermore, we study the modification of the shadow structure in the presence of a radially infalling, optically thin accretion flow within a generalized framework. Our results indicate that both the global monopole charge and Lorentz-violating parameters significantly influence the photon sphere, lensing observables, and shadow morphology, potentially providing observational signatures for testing bumblebee gravity in the strong-field regime.\n📄 Download PDF\nMulti-Frequency Study of FRB20201124A with the uGMRT Authors: C. Dudeja, J. Roy, U. Panda, S. Bhattacharyya Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe present results from multi-epoch observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) during its active phase between 8 May and 28 May 2021. The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections. These findings demonstrate that FRB 20201124A exhibits closely spaced, patchy, multi-frequency emission with frequency-dependent activity, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of repeating FRBs.\n📄 Download PDF\nFundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing – Part II: Wide-Band Systems Authors: Tong Wei, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Bhavani Shankar M. R., Björn Ottersten Venue: arXiv (2025)\nNear-field sensing with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) in practical 6G systems is expected to operate over broad bandwidths, where delay, Doppler, and spatial effects become tightly coupled across frequency. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram’er–Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian–Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations.\n📄 Download PDF\nFundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing – Part I: Narrow-Band Systems Authors: Tong Wei, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Bhavani Shankar M. R., Björn Ottersten Venue: arXiv (2025)\nExtremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) envisioned for 6G enable high-resolution sensing. However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian–Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram’er–Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.\n📄 Download PDF\nSimulations of two-dimensional single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability using front-tracking/ghost-fluid method: comparison to experiments and theory Authors: James Burton, Tulin Kaman Venue: arXiv (2025)\nTwo-dimensional single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) is simulated using an accurate and robust front-tracking/ghost-fluid method (FT/GFM) with high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme. We compare our numerical results with the single-mode RTI experiments of Renoult, Rosenblatt and Carles (2015). The time evolution of the interface between two immiscible fluids and the effects of surface tension on the growth of the amplitude and asymmetry of the perturbed interface are examined for the initial wavelength 1 cm and the Atwood number A=0.29. The important features of RTI flows such as interface profiles, bubble/spike penetration and velocities show good agreement between experiments and simulations of immiscible fluids with surface tension. The velocity vector fields for the bubble and spike in the linear and nonlinear regimes are consistent with the theory for the single wavelength perturbation.\n📄 Download PDF\nMelting curve of correlated iron at Earth’s core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT Authors: Rishi Rao, Li Zhu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nReliable constraints on iron’s melting curve at Earth’s inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.\n📄 Download PDF\nGenerative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions Authors: Alexander C. Li, Ananya Kumar, Deepak Pathak Venue: arXiv (2025)\nDiscriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.\n📄 Download PDF\nApproximations for the Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance Problem with Intergenic Region Information Authors: Gabriel Siqueira, Alexsandro Oliveira Alexandrino, Zanoni Dias Venue: arXiv (2025)\nGenome rearrangement distances are an established method in genome comparison. Works in this area may include various rearrangement operations representing large-scale mutations, gene orientation information, the number of nucleotides in intergenic regions, and weights reflecting the expected frequency of each operation. In this article, we model genomes containing at most one copy of each gene by considering gene sequences, with orientations, and representing intergenic regions according to their nucleotide lengths. We looked at a problem called Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance, which seeks the minimal cost sequence composed by the rearrangement operations of reversals, transposition, and indels, capable of transforming one genome into another. We leverage a structure called Labeled Intergenic Breakpoint Graph to show an algorithm for that problem with guaranteed approximations considering some sets of weights for the operations.\n📄 Download PDF\nAdvances in Agentic AI: Back to the Future Authors: Sergio Alvarez-Telena, Marta Diez-Fernandez Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIn light of the recent convergence between Agentic AI and our field of Algorithmization, this paper seeks to restore conceptual clarity and provide a structured analytical framework for an increasingly fragmented discourse. First, (a) it examines the contemporary landscape and proposes precise definitions for the key notions involved, ranging from intelligence to Agentic AI. Second, (b) it reviews our prior body of work to contextualize the evolution of methodologies and technological advances developed over the past decade, highlighting their interdependencies and cumulative trajectory. Third, (c) by distinguishing Machine and Learning efforts within the field of Machine Learning (d) it introduces the first Machine in Machine Learning (M1) as the underlying platform enabling today’s LLM-based Agentic AI, conceptualized as an extension of B2C information-retrieval user experiences now being repurposed for B2B transformation. Building on this distinction, (e) the white paper develops the notion of the second Machine in Machine Learning (M2) as the architectural prerequisite for holistic, production-grade B2B transformation, characterizing it as Strategies-based Agentic AI and grounding its definition in the structural barriers-to-entry that such systems must overcome to be operationally viable. Further, (f) it offers conceptual and technical insight into what appears to be the first fully realized implementation of an M2. Finally, drawing on the demonstrated accuracy of the two previous decades of professional and academic experience in developing the foundational architectures of Algorithmization, (g) it outlines a forward-looking research and transformation agenda for the coming two decades.\n📄 Download PDF\nCellSecInspector: Safeguarding Cellular Networks via Automated Security Analysis on Specifications Authors: Ke Xie, Xingyi Zhao, Yiwen Hu, Munshi Saifuzzaman, Wen Li, Shuhan Yuan, Tian Xie, Guan-Hua Tu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe complexity, interdependence, and rapid evolution of 3GPP specifications present fundamental challenges for ensuring the security of modern cellular networks. Manual reviews and existing automated approaches, which often depend on rule-based parsing or small sets of manually crafted security requirements, fail to capture deep semantic dependencies, cross-sentence/clause relationships, and evolving specification behaviors. In this work, we present CellSecInspector, an automated framework for security analysis of 3GPP specifications. CellSecInspector extracts structured state-condition-action (SCA) representations, models mobile network procedures with comprehensive function chains, systematically validates them against 9 foundational security properties under 4 adversarial scenarios, and automatically generates test cases. This end-to-end pipeline enables the automated discovery of vulnerabilities without relying on manually predefined security requirements or rules. Applying CellSecInspector to the well-studied 5G and 4G NAS and RRC specifications, it discovers 43 vulnerabilities, 8 of which are previously unreported. Our findings show that CellSecInspector is a scalable, adaptive, and effective solution to assess 3GPP specifications for safeguarding operational and next-generation cellular networks.\n📄 Download PDF\nEffects of Algorithmic Visibility on Conspiracy Communities: Reddit after Epstein’s ‘Suicide’ Authors: Asja Attanasio, Francesco Corso, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Francesco Pierri Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThis paper examines how algorithmic visibility shapes a large conspiracy community on Reddit after Jeffrey Epstein’s death. We ask whether homepage exposure changes who join r/conspiracy, how long they stay, and how they adapt linguistically, compared with users who arrive through organic discovery. Using a computational framework that combines toxicity scores, survival analysis, and lexical and semantic measures, the study shows that homepage visibility acts as a selection mechanism rather than a simple amplifier. Users who discover the community organically integrate more quickly into its linguistic and thematic norms and show more stable engagement over time. By contrast, users who arrive through visibility on the homepage remain semantically distant from core discourse and participate more briefly. Overall, algorithmic visibility reshapes audience size, community composition, and linguistic cohesion: newcomers who do not join organically have different incentives, integrate weakly, and leave quickly, which limits organic growth. In this high-risk setting, the observed behavioral and linguistic trajectories over five months do not match standard narratives in which incidental exposure to conspiracy content produces durable radicalization. These findings can inform the design of web platforms and recommendation systems that seek to curb harmful conspiracy exposure while supporting more responsible, transparent, and socially beneficial uses of algorithmic recommendations.\n📄 Download PDF\nEnhancing LLM-Based Neural Network Generation: Few-Shot Prompting and Efficient Validation for Automated Architecture Design Authors: Chandini Vysyaraju, Raghuvir Duvvuri, Avi Goyal, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte Venue: arXiv (2025)\nAutomated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.\n📄 Download PDF\nExplaining News Bias Detection: A Comparative SHAP Analysis of Transformer Model Decision Mechanisms Authors: Himel Ghosh Venue: arXiv (2025)\nAutomated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.\n📄 Download PDF\nAmplitude constraints on dark energy Authors: Scott Melville Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThis talk gives a short introduction to the UV/EFT correspondence\", which uses scattering amplitudes to relate the Effective Field Theory (EFT) coefficients probed by low-energy measurements to properties of the underlying high-energy (UV) completion. This includes recent positivity bounds\" on EFT coefficients, which are the low-energy signatures of causality and unitarity in the UV. To illustrate their phenomenological impact, I apply these bounds to a simple EFT for dark energy and compare with recent cosmological observations.\n📄 Download PDF\nLoop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model Authors: Shufang Qiang, Peiwen Wu, Yongchao Zhang Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\\ell_β\\to \\ell_α+ X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.\n📄 Download PDF\nSemiclassics, branes, and extremality Authors: Adolfo Holguin Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe revisit the problem of computing extremal and non-extremal three point functions of semiclassical probes with single trace operators and point out certain inconsistencies in previous approaches in the literature. We clarify the roles of wavefunctions and averaging over moduli, concluding that holographic computations may be performed with or without averaging. By carefully implementing the extrapolate dictionary for extremal correlators we explain the origin of the apparent mismatch between supergravity and CFT for extremal correlators involving giant gravitons in type IIB supergravity. We propose an ansatz for the wavefunctions of half-BPS giants which reproduces large $N$ limit of certain extremal two and three point functions in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.\n📄 Download PDF\nCosmic Himalayas in CROCODILE : Probing the Extreme Quasar Overdensities by Count-in-Cells analysis and Nearest Neighbor Distribution Authors: Yuto Kuwayama, Yongming Liang, Kentaro Nagamine, Yuri Oku, Daisuke Nishihama, Daisuke Toyouchi, Keita Fukushima, Hidenobu Yajima, Hyunbae Park, Masami Ouchi Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) – an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 – poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.\n📄 Download PDF\nMatrix Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Non-Abelian Charge Transport Authors: Domingos S. P. Salazar Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) bound the precision of currents by entropy production, but quantum transport of noncommuting (non-Abelian) charges challenges standard formulations because different charge components cannot be monitored within a single classical frame. We derive a process-level matrix TUR starting from the operational entropy production $Σ= D(ρ’{SE}|ρ’S!\\otimes!ρ_E)$. Isolating the experimentally accessible bath divergence $D{\\mathrm{bath}}=D(ρ’E|ρ_E)$, we prove a fully nonlinear, saturable lower bound valid for arbitrary current vectors $Δq$: $D{\\mathrm{bath}} \\ge B(Δq,V,V’)$, where the bound depends only on the transported-charge signal $Δq$ and the pre/post collision covariance matrices $V$ and $V’$. In the small-fluctuation regime $D{\\mathrm{bath}}\\geq\\frac12,Δq^{\\mathsf T}V^{-1}Δq+O(|Δq|^4)$, while beyond linear response it remains accurate. Numerical strong-coupling qubit collisions illustrate the bound and demonstrate near-saturation across broad parameter ranges using only local measurements on the bath probe.\n📄 Download PDF\nNo-cost Bell Nonlocality Certification from Quantum Tomography and Its Applications in Quantum Magic Witnessing Authors: Pawel Cieslinski, Lukas Knips, Harald Weinfurter, Wieslaw Laskowski Venue: arXiv (2025)\nTomographic measurements are the standard tool for characterizing quantum states, yet they are usually regarded only as means for state reconstruction or fidelity measurement. Here, we show that the same Pauli-basis measurements (X, Y, Z) can be directly employed for the certification of nonlocality at no additional experimental cost. Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets – to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications.\n📄 Download PDF\nFeeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency Authors: Qinan Wang, David O.

Fox, Suvi Gezari, Sebastian Gomez, Peter McGill, Armin Rest, César Rojas-Bravo, Melissa Shahbandeh, Lou Strolger Venue: arXiv (2025)\nUpcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical–UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\\mathring{\\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\\gtrsim0.2$. We demonstrate that, if confirmed, such evolution could lead to a few-percent bias in the measurement of $w$ if high-$z$ rest-frame UV data are included in future cosmological surveys such as LSST and $\\textit{Roman}$.\n📄 Download PDF\nExtreme nonlinear optics in optical fibers Authors: Mario Ferraro, Bertrand Kibler, Pierre Béjot, Frédéric Gérome, Benoit Debord, Fetah Benabid, Fabio Mangini, Stefan Wabnitz Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThis paper reviews the field of extreme nonlinear optics in optical fibers, highlighting key phenomena and advancements. It discusses multiple ionization effects caused by femtosecond laser pulses that generate plasma and induce permanent material modifications, as well as plasma luminescence and its dependence on material imperfections. The formation and dynamics of plasma filaments, including helical structures, are explored, along with the rainbow spiral emission pattern useful in communications and particle manipulation. The review covers the generation of spatial-temporal waves, supercontinuum broadening, and advanced modeling techniques, such as multimode unidirectional pulse propagation equations for describing optical pulse evolution. Experimental demonstrations involving discretized conical waves and supercontinuum generation optimization are detailed. The paper emphasizes the unique capabilities of photonic crystal fibers, especially hollow-core variants, in achieving broad supercontinua and Raman frequency combs, ultrashort pulse compression, high-harmonic generation, plasma formation, and nonclassical light production. Our outlook highlights ongoing research into spatiotemporal helicon waves, ultrashort pulse propagation, vacuum ultraviolet and mid-infrared supercontinuum generation, and innovative fiber technologies. Future directions focus on enhancing fiber performance, understanding multimodal wave dynamics, and expanding applications in telecommunications, sensing, and quantum science.\n📄 Download PDF\nBayesian Elastic Net Regression with Structured Prior Dependence Authors: Christopher M. Hans, Ningyi Liu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nMany regularization priors for Bayesian regression assume the regression coefficients are a priori independent. In particular this is the case for standard Bayesian treatments of the lasso and the elastic net. While independence may be reasonable in some data-analytic settings, incorporating dependence in these prior distributions provides greater modeling flexibility. This paper introduces the orthant normal distribution in its general form and shows how it can be used to structure prior dependence in the Bayesian elastic net regression model. An L1-regularized version of Zellner’s g prior is introduced as a special case, creating a new link between the literature on penalized optimization and an important class of regression priors. Computation is challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant in the prior. We avoid this issue by modifying slightly a standard prior of convenience for the hyperparameters in such a way to enable simple and fast Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution. The benefit of including structured prior dependence in the Bayesian elastic net regression model is demonstrated through simulation and a near-infrared spectroscopy data example.\n📄 Download PDF\nPrimordial black hole dark matter from ultra-slow-roll inflation in Horndeski gravity Authors: Despina Totolou, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Emmanuel N. Saridakis Venue: arXiv (2025)\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16}),M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.\n📄 Download PDF\nDiscovering Coordinated Joint Options via Inter-Agent Relative Dynamics Authors: Raul D. Steleac, Mohan Sridharan, David Abel Venue: arXiv (2025)\nTemporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.\n📄 Download PDF\nMulti-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis under unseen working conditions Authors: Pengcheng Xia, Yixiang Huang, Chengjin Qin, Chengliang Liu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIntelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Chung, Abhinandan Antony, Nishchhal Verma, Luke N. Holtzman, Katayun Barmak, Raquel Queiroz, James Hone, Robert M. Westervelt, Kin Chung Fong Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIdentifying the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors plays an essential role in the ongoing quest to understand correlated electronic matter. A long-standing approach is to study the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $λ$ for evidence of nodal points where the superconducting gap vanishes. However, experimental reports can be ambiguous due to the requisite low-temperature resolution, and the similarity in signatures of nodal quasiparticles and impurity states. Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $λ$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $λ$. The high precision of this technique allows us to observe power-law temperature dependence of $λ$, and to measure the anomalous nonlinear Meissner effect – the current dependence of $λ$ arising from nodal quasiparticles. Together, these measurements provide smoking gun signatures of nodal superconductivity.\n📄 Download PDF\nClassification of ancient cylindrical mean curvature flows and the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture Authors: Richard H. Bamler, Yi Lai Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe resolve the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture for mean curvature flows in all dimensions and for all types of cylindrical singularities. Specifically, we show that if the tangent flow at a singular point is a multiplicity-one cylinder, then in a neighborhood of that point the flow is mean-convex, its time-slices arise as level sets of a continuous function, and all nearby tangent flows are cylindrical. Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description. Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \\emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds’’ argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons. Our method is independent of prior work and, together with our prequel paper, this work is largely self-contained.\n📄 Download PDF\n🔍 psycholinguistics Arithmetic with spatiotemporal optical vortex of integer and fractional topological charges Authors: Hsiao-Chih Huang, Chen-Ting Liao, Hui Min Leung Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSpatiotemporal optical vortices carry transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM), which give rise to spatiotemporal topological charge (ST-TC). To unleash the full potential of t-OAM in expanding the capacity of communication and computing, we demonstrate the first optical information-processing pipeline capable of performing addition and subtraction on ST-TC values, regardless of whether they are integer or fractional. Additionally, we established a readout method for those mathematical operations through imaging spectral analysis, providing a robust optical basis toward arithmetic operations and verification. These new capabilities mark crucial advancements toward full arithmetic operations on the ST-TC of light for bosonic state computation and information processing.\n📄 Download PDF\nBest Practices for Modelling Electrides Authors: Lee A. Burton Venue: arXiv (2025)\nMaterials in which electrons occupy interstitial sites as anions are called electrides and exhibit unusual dimensionality-dependent electronic behavior. These properties make electrides attractive for catalysis, transparent conductors, and emergent quantum phenomena, yet their theoretical treatment remains challenging. In conventional materials, the ground-state atomic structure dictates the electronic configuration, whereas in electrides the electronic structure can instead govern the atomic arrangement. Here, the performance of commonly used exchange-correlation functionals is evaluated for representative one-, two-, and three-dimensional electrides. The results show that higher-cost approaches do not necessarily perform better across all cases, while standard methods capture the qualitative electride character and many key energetic and structural trends with surprising reliability. This behavior, likely arising from fortuitous error cancellation, supports the reliability of legacy studies in the field and the viability of efficient high-throughput exploration using low-cost methods. Overall, the findings support a tiered computational strategy for electride modelling, integrating system-specific heuristics with efficient first-principles screening. This approach balances computational feasibility with physical fidelity and underscores the continuing leadership of theory in the predictive discovery of electride materials across dimensionalities.\n📄 Download PDF\nThe Radon–Nikodym topography of acyclic measured graphs Authors: Anush Tserunyan, Robin Tucker-Drob Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe study locally countable acyclic measure-class-preserving (mcp) Borel graphs by analyzing their “topography” – the interaction between the geometry and the associated Radon–Nikodym cocycle. We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure. At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended. Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon–Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis.\n📄 Download PDF\nFundamental limits for weighted empirical approximations of tilted distributions Authors: Sarvesh Ravichandran Iyer, Himadri Mandal, Dhruman Gupta, Rushil Gupta, Agniv Bandhyopadhyay, Achal Bassamboo, Varun Gupta, Sandeep Juneja Venue: arXiv (2025)\nConsider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.\n📄 Download PDF\nSyndrome aware mitigation of logical errors Authors: Dorit Aharonov, Yosi Atia, Eyal Bairey, Zvika Brakerski, Itsik Cohen, Omri Golan, Ilya Gurwich, Netanel H. Lindner, Maor Shutman Venue: arXiv (2025)\nBroad applications of quantum computers will require error correction (EC). However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute. We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.\n📄 Download PDF\nAn exceptional set of uniformly spread Kakutani tilings of the line Authors: Yotam Smilansky Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe α-Kakutani substitution rule splits the unit interval into two subintervals of lengths alpha and 1 - α, for a fixed α in (0,1). A simple inflation-substitution procedure produces tilings of the real line and their associated Delone sets. We show that there are precisely five distinct values of min(α, 1 - α) for which these sets are uniformly spread, meaning that they are a bounded displacement of a lattice. The proof of this surprising fact combines the construction and analysis of a related family of primitive substitution tilings, Solomon’s criterion for uniform spreadness, and a classification of Pisot-Vijayaraghavan polynomials.\n📄 Download PDF\nPhysTalk: Language-driven Real-time Physics in 3D Gaussian Scenes Authors: Luca Collorone, Mert Kiray, Indro Spinelli, Fabio Galasso, Benjamin Busam Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRealistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a “render and wait” paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.\n📄 Download PDF\nSymSeqBench: a unified framework for the generation and analysis of rule-based symbolic sequences and datasets Authors: Barna Zajzon, Younes Bouhadjar, Maxime Fabre, Felix Schmidt, Noah Ostendorf, Emre Neftci, Abigail Morrison, Renato Duarte Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.\n📄 Download PDF\nThe Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production Authors: Hangcheng Zhao, Ron Berman Venue: arXiv (2025)\nLarge language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers’ websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news “slop.” Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard. Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies. Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.\n📄 Download PDF\nMAMA-Memeia! Multi-Aspect Multi-Agent Collaboration for Depressive Symptoms Identification in Memes Authors: Siddhant Agarwal, Adya Dhuler, Polly Ruhnke, Melvin Speisman, Md Shad Akhtar, Shweta Yadav Venue: arXiv (2025)\nOver the past years, memes have evolved from being exclusively a medium of humorous exchanges to one that allows users to express a range of emotions freely and easily. With the ever-growing utilization of memes in expressing depressive sentiments, we conduct a study on identifying depressive symptoms exhibited by memes shared by users of online social media platforms. We introduce RESTOREx as a vital resource for detecting depressive symptoms in memes on social media through the Large Language Model (LLM) generated and human-annotated explanations. We introduce MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework grounded in the clinical psychology method of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies. MAMAMemeia improves upon the current state-of-the-art by 7.55% in macro-F1 and is established as the new benchmark compared to over 30 methods.\n📄 Download PDF\nLarge language models and the entropy of English Authors: Colin Scheibner, Lindsay M. Smith, William Bialek Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.\n📄 Download PDF\nSpectral Graph Neural Networks for Cognitive Task Classification in fMRI Connectomes Authors: Debasis Maji, Arghya Banerjee, Debaditya Barman Venue: arXiv (2025)\nCognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.\n📄 Download PDF\nReliable and Resilient Collective Communication Library for LLM Training and Serving Authors: Wei Wang, Nengneng Yu, Sixian Xiong, Zaoxing Liu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nModern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10–15% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1% training and less than 3% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\\times$ and 47$\\times$, respectively.\n📄 Download PDF\nModewise Additive Factor Model for Matrix Time Series Authors: Elynn Chen, Yuefeng Han, Jiayu Li, Ke Xu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe introduce a Modewise Additive Factor Model (MAFM) for matrix-valued time series that captures row-specific and column-specific latent effects through an additive structure, offering greater flexibility than multiplicative frameworks such as Tucker and CP factor models. In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we establish matrix Bernstein inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent matrix time series. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.\n📄 Download PDF\n🔍 llm Multivariate Generalized Counting Process via Gamma Subordination Authors: Manisha Dhillon, Kuldeep Kumar Kataria, Shyan Ghosh Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIn this paper, we study a multivariate gamma subordinator whose components are independent gamma processes subject to a random time governed by an independent negative binomial process. We derive the explicit expressions for its joint Laplace-Stieltjes transform, its probability density function and the associated governing differential equations. Also, we study a time-changed variant of the multivariate generalized counting process where the time is changed by an independent multivariate gamma subordinator. For this time-changed process, we obtain the corresponding Lévy measure and probability mass function. Later, we discuss an application of the time-changed multivariate generalized counting process to a shock model.\n📄 Download PDF\nUniversal Seesaw Pati-Salam Model with P for Strong CP Authors: K. S. Babu, Sumit Biswas Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe develop a universal seesaw version of the Pati-Salam model wherein quarks and leptons of each family are unified into common multiplets transforming as $ψ_L(2,1,4))+ ψ_R((1,2,4)$ under the $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times SU(4)_c$ gauge symmetry. Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level. Small and finite Majorana neutrino masses are induced via one-loop diagrams, which we analyze and show to be compatible with oscillation experiments.\n📄 Download PDF\nOn Nonlinear Inertial Transformations Authors: Nicholas Agia Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIt is often assumed that the most general transformation between two inertial reference frames is affine linear in their Cartesian coordinates, an assumption which is however not true. We provide a complete derivation of the most general inertial frame transformation, which is indeed nonlinear; along the way, we shall find that the conditions of preserving the Law of Inertia take the form of Schwarzian differential equations, providing perhaps the simplest possible physics setting in which the Schwarzian derivative appears. We then demonstrate that the most general such inertial transformation which further preserves the speed of light in all directions is, however, still affine linear. Physically, this paper may be viewed as a reduction of the number of postulates needed to uniquely specify special relativity by one, as well as a proof that inertial transformations automatically imbue spacetime with a vector space structure, albeit in one higher dimension than might be expected. Mathematically, this paper may be viewed as a derivation of the higher-dimensional analog of the Schwarzian differential equation and its most general solution.\n📄 Download PDF\nUniversal polar dual pairs of spherical codes found in $E_8$ and $Λ_{24}$ Authors: S. V. Borodachov, P. G. Boyvalenkov, P. D. Dragnev, D. P. Hardin, E. B. Saff, M. M. Stoyanova Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe identify universal polar dual pairs of spherical codes $C$ and $D$ such that for a large class of potential functions $h$ the minima of the discrete $h$-potential of $C$ on the sphere occur at the points of $D$ and vice versa. Moreover, the minimal values of their normalized potentials are equal. These codes arise from the known sharp codes embedded in the even unimodular extremal lattices $E_8$ and $Λ_{24}$ (Leech lattice). This embedding allows us to use the lattices’ properties to find new universal polar dual pairs. In the process we extensively utilize the interplay between the binary Golay codes and the Leech lattice. As a byproduct of our analysis, we identify a new universally optimal (in the sense of energy) code in the projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^{21}$ with $1408$ points (lines). Furthermore, we extend the Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel definition of derived codes from their seminal $1977$ paper and generalize their Theorem 8.2 to show that if a $τ$-design is enclosed in $k\\leq τ$ parallel hyperplanes, then each of the hyperplane’s sub-code is a $(τ+1-k)$-design in the ambient subspace.\n📄 Download PDF\nLarge Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions: From Effective Field Theory to Ultraviolet Completions Authors: K. S. Babu, P. S. Bhupal Dev, Anil Thapa Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe develop a general effective field theory (EFT) framework for neutrino-dark matter (DM) interactions, and apply it to systematically find all possible gauge-invariant ultraviolet (UV) completions at a given EFT operator dimension. Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models. Phenomenological implications for DM thermal relic abundance and direct detection prospects, as well as various cosmological and laboratory constraints on the model parameter space, are also analyzed.\n📄 Download PDF\n🔍 neuroscience Securing High-Concurrency Ticket Sales: A Framework Based on Microservice Authors: Zhiyong Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhang, Xiaoqi Li Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the “add passenger” function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.\n📄 Download PDF\n🔍 data_resources R-Debater: Retrieval-Augmented Debate Generation through Argumentative Memory Authors: Maoyuan Li, Zhongsheng Wang, Haoyuan Li, Jiamou Liu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.\n📄 Download PDF\nYoutu-LLM: Unlocking the Native Agentic Potential for Lightweight Large Language Models Authors: Junru Lu, Jiarui Qin, Lingfeng Qiao, Yinghui Li, Xinyi Dai, Bo Ke, Jianfeng He, Ruizhi Qiao, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Yunsheng Wu, Yinsong Liu, Shuangyin Liu, Mingkong Tang, Haodong Lin, Jiayi Kuang, Fanxu Meng, Xiaojuan Tang, Yunjia Xi, Junjie Huang, Haotong Yang, Zhenyi Shen, Yangning Li, Qianwen Zhang, Yifei Yu, Siyu An, Junnan Dong, Qiufeng Wang, Jie Wang, Keyu Chen, Wei Wen, Taian Guo, Zhifeng Shen, Daohai Yu, Jiahao Li, Ke Li, Zongyi Li, Xiaoyu Tan Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled “Commonsense-STEM-Agent” Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.\n📄 Download PDF\nEfficiently Estimating Data Efficiency for Language Model Fine-tuning Authors: Gyung Hyun Je, Colin Raffel Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWhile large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task’s data efficiency–i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance–is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task’s data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task’s data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.\n📄 Download PDF\nSemi-Supervised Diversity-Aware Domain Adaptation for 3D Object detection Authors: Bartłomiej Olber, Jakub Winter, Paweł Wawrzyński, Andrii Gamalii, Daniel Górniak, Marcin Łojek, Robert Nowak, Krystian Radlak Venue: arXiv (2025)\n3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.\n📄 Download PDF\n🔍 emotion_language Classification of Interacting Topological Crystalline Superconductors in Three Dimensions and Beyond Authors: Shang-Qiang Ning, Xing-Yu Ren, Qing-Rui Wang, Yang Qi, Zheng-Cheng Gu Venue: arXiv (2025)\nAlthough classification for free-fermion topological superconductors (TSC) is established, systematically understanding the classification of 3D interacting TSCs remains difficult, especially those protected by crystalline symmetries like the 230 space groups. We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems.\n📄 Download PDF\nClassifying long legal documents using short random chunks Authors: Luis Adrián Cabrera-Diego Venue: arXiv (2025)\nClassifying legal documents is a challenge, besides their specialized vocabulary, sometimes they can be very long. This means that feeding full documents to a Transformers-based models for classification might be impossible, expensive or slow. Thus, we present a legal document classifier based on DeBERTa V3 and a LSTM, that uses as input a collection of 48 randomly-selected short chunks (max 128 tokens). Besides, we present its deployment pipeline using Temporal, a durable execution solution, which allow us to have a reliable and robust processing workflow. The best model had a weighted F-score of 0.898, while the pipeline running on CPU had a processing median time of 498 seconds per 100 files.\n📄 Download PDF\nManifold classification from the descriptive viewpoint Authors: Jeffrey Bergfalk, Iian B. Smythe Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe consider classification problems for manifolds and discrete subgroups of Lie groups from a descriptive set-theoretic point of view. This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $={\\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan–Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck–Zimmer and Andretta–Camerlo–Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth–Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $={\\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions.\n📄 Download PDF\nSequential Bayesian parameter-state estimation in dynamical systems with noisy and incomplete observations via a variational framework Authors: Liliang Wang, Alex Gorodetsky Venue: arXiv (2025)\nOnline joint estimation of unknown parameters and states in a dynamical system with uncertainty quantification is crucial in many applications. For example, digital twins dynamically update their knowledge of model parameters and states to support prediction and decision-making. Reliability and computational speed are vital for DTs. Online parameter-state estimation ensures computational efficiency, while uncertainty quantification is essential for making reliable predictions and decisions. In parameter-state estimation, the joint distribution of the state and model parameters conditioned on the data, termed the joint posterior, provides accurate uncertainty quantification. Because the joint posterior is generally intractable to compute, this paper presents an online variational inference framework to compute its approximation at each time step. The approximation is factorized into a marginal distribution over the model parameters and a state distribution conditioned on the parameters. This factorization enables recursive updates through a two-stage procedure: first, the parameter posterior is approximated via variational inference; second, the state distribution conditioned on the parameters is computed using Gaussian filtering based on the estimated parameter posterior. The algorithmic design is supported by a theorem establishing upper bounds on the joint posterior approximation error. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method (i) matches the performance of the joint particle filter in low-dimensional problems, accurately inferring both unobserved states and unknown parameters of dynamical and observation models; (ii) remains robust under noisy, partial observations and model discrepancies in a chaotic Lorenz 96 system; and (iii) scales effectively to a high-dimensional convection-diffusion system, where it outperforms the joint ensemble Kalman filter.\n📄 Download PDF\nThe PDE-ODI principle and cylindrical mean curvature flows Authors: Richard H. Bamler, Yi Lai Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \\emph{PDE–ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order. As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality. Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained.\n📄 Download PDF\nOn exact Observability for Compactly perturbed infinite dimension system Authors: Nisrine Charaf, Faouzi Triki Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIn this paper, we study the observability of compactly perturbed infinite dimensional systems. Assuming that a given infinite-dimensional system with self-adjoint generator is exactly observable we derive sufficient conditions on a compact self adjoint perturbation to guarantee that the perturbed system stays exactly observable. The analysis is based on a careful asymptotic estimation of the spectral elements of the perturbed unbounded operator in terms of the compact perturbation. These intermediate results are of importance themselves.\n📄 Download PDF\nFractal conduction pathways governing ionic transport in a glass Authors: J. L. Iguain, F. O. Sanchez-Varreti, M. A. Frechero Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe present a systematic characterization of the fractal conduction pathways governing ionic transport in a non-crystalline solid below the glass-transition temperature. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations of lithium metasilicate, we combine mobility-resolved dynamical analysis with a real-space description of the regions explored by lithium ions. Ensemble-averaged velocity autocorrelation functions rapidly decorrelate and do not resolve the pronounced dynamic heterogeneity of the system, whereas single-ion analysis reveals short-lived episodes of nearly collinear motion. By mapping active-site clusters over increasing time windows, we show that ion-conducting pathways are quasi one-dimensional at short times and evolve into larger, branched structures characterized by a robust fractal dimension $d_f\\simeq1.7$. This geometry persists while the silicate backbone remains structurally arrested, whereas near the glass-transition temperature the loss of structural memory leads to the reappearance of small clusters. These results provide a real-space structural interpretation of ionic transport in non-crystalline solids and support fractal pathway models of high-frequency ionic response.\n📄 Download PDF\nDetector Response Matrices, Effective Areas, and Flash-Effective Areas for Radiation Detectors Authors: Gregory Bowers, Eve Chase, William Ford, Daniel Coupland, Brian Larsen, Caleb Roecker, Karl Smith, Kurtis Bartlett, Katherine Gattiker Katherine Mesick Venue: arXiv (2025)\nA Detector Response Matrix (DRM) is a discrete representation of an instrument’s Detector Response Function (DRF), which quantifies how many discrete energy depositions occur in a detector volume for a given distribution of particles incident on the detector. For simple radiation detectors that can count such energy depositions (such as scintillators, Proportional Counter Tubes (PCTs), etc), we consider the ideal counting DRF, $\\mathbf{G}\\varphi (E\\mathrm{in}, E_\\mathrm{dep})$, which relates the detector’s counting histogram (number of energy depositions within a given channel) to an incident particles characterization, $\\varphi$ (e.g. incident flux, fluence, intensity). From the counting DRF we can derive the counting DRM, the effective area, and the flash effective area (which measures the total energy deposited in the detector from a large, instantaneous fluence).\n📄 Download PDF\nDissipative corrections to the particle momentum spectrum of a decoupling fluid Authors: Francesco Becattini, Daniele Roselli, Xin-Li Sheng Venue: arXiv (2025)\nWe present an \\emph{ab initio} calculation within quantum statistical field theory and linear response theory, of the dissipative correction to the momentum spectrum of scalar particles emitted at decoupling (freeze-out) from a relativistic fluid assuming the initial state to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We obtain an expansion of the Wigner function of the interacting quantum field in terms of the gradients of the classical thermo-hydrodynamic fields - four-temperature vector and reduced chemical potential - evaluated on the initial local-equilibrium hypersurface, rather than on the decoupling (freeze-out) hypersurface as usual in kinetic theory. The gradient expansion includes an unexpected zeroth order term depending on the differences between thermo-hydrodynamic fields at the decoupling and the initial hypersurface. This term encodes a memory of the initial state which is related to the long-distance persistence of the correlation function between Wigner operator and stress-energy tensor and charged current that is discussed in detail. We address the phenomenological implications of these corrections for the momentum spectra measured in relativistic nuclear collisions.\n📄 Download PDF\nStrategies for Overcoming Gradient Troughs in the ADAPT-VQE Algorithm Authors: Jonas Stadelmann, Julian Übelher, Mafalda Ramôa, Bharath Sambasivam, Edwin Barnes, Sophia E. Economou Venue: arXiv (2025)\nThe adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.\n📄 Download PDF\nLaser intracavity absorption magnetometry for optical quantum sensing Authors: J. M. Wollenberg, F. Perona, A. Palaci, H. Wenzel, H. Christopher, A. Knigge, W. Knolle, J. M. Bopp, T. Schröder Venue: arXiv (2025)\nIntracavity absorption spectroscopy (ICAS) is a well-established technique for detecting weak absorption signals with ultrahigh sensitivity. Here, we extend this concept to magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We introduce laser intracavity absorption magnetometry (LICAM), a concept that is in principle applicable to a broader class of optical quantum sensors, including optically pumped magnetometers. Using an electrically driven, edge-emitting diode laser that operates self-sustainably, we show that LICAM enables highly sensitive magnetometers operating under ambient conditions. Near the lasing threshold, we achieve a 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and a 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity compared with a conventional single-pass geometry. The experimental results are accurately described by a rate-equation model for single-mode diode lasers. From our measurements, we determine a projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity in the $\\mathrm{pT},\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ range and show that, with realistic device improvements, sensitivities down to the $\\mathrm{fT},\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ scale are attainable.\n📄 Download PDF\nCompound Estimation for Binomials Authors: Yan Chen, Lihua Lei Venue: arXiv (2025)\nMany applications involve estimating the mean of multiple binomial outcomes as a common problem – assessing intergenerational mobility of census tracts, estimating prevalence of infectious diseases across countries, and measuring click-through rates for different demographic groups. The most standard approach is to report the plain average of each outcome. Despite simplicity, the estimates are noisy when the sample sizes or mean parameters are small. In contrast, the Empirical Bayes (EB) methods are able to boost the average accuracy by borrowing information across tasks. Nevertheless, the EB methods require a Bayesian model where the parameters are sampled from a prior distribution which, unlike the commonly-studied Gaussian case, is unidentified due to discreteness of binomial measurements. Even if the prior distribution is known, the computation is difficult when the sample sizes are heterogeneous as there is no simple joint conjugate prior for the sample size and mean parameter. In this paper, we consider the compound decision framework which treats the sample size and mean parameters as fixed quantities. We develop an approximate Stein’s Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) for the average mean squared error given any class of estimators. For a class of machine learning-assisted linear shrinkage estimators, we establish asymptotic optimality, regret bounds, and valid inference. Unlike existing work, we work with the binomials directly without resorting to Gaussian approximations. This allows us to work with small sample sizes and/or mean parameters in both one-sample and two-sample settings. We demonstrate our approach using three datasets on firm discrimination, education outcomes, and innovation rates.\n📄 Download PDF\nGeometric characterisation of structural and regular equivalences in undirected (hyper)graphs Authors: Marzieh Eidi, Nina Otter Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSimilarity notions between vertices in a graph, such as structural and regular equivalence, are one of the main ingredients in clustering tools in complex network science. We generalise structural and regular equivalences for undirected hypergraphs and provide a characterisation of structural and regular equivalences of undirected graphs and hypergraphs through neighbourhood graphs and Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Our characterisation sheds new light on these similarity notions opening a new avenue for their exploration. These characterisations also enable the construction of a possibly wide family of regular partitions, thereby offering a new route to a task that has so far been computationally challenging.\n📄 Download PDF\nAntecedents of Consumer Regret Frequency: The Roles of Decision Agency, Status Signaling, and Online Shopping Preference Authors: Shawn Berry Venue: arXiv (2025)\nConsumer regret is a widespread post-purchase emotion that significantly impacts satisfaction, product returns, complaint behavior, and customer loyalty. Despite its prevalence, there is a limited understanding of why certain consumers experience regret more frequently as a chronic aspect of their engagement in the marketplace. This study explores the antecedents of consumer regret frequency by integrating decision agency, status signaling motivations, and online shopping preferences into a cohesive framework. By analyzing survey data (n=338), we assess whether consumers’ perceived agency and decision-making orientation correlate with the frequency of regret, and whether tendencies towards status-related consumption and preferences for online shopping environments exacerbate regret through mechanisms such as increased social comparison, expanded choice sets, and continuous exposure to alternative offers. The findings reveal that regret frequency is significantly linked to individual differences in decision-related orientations and status signaling, with a preference for online shopping further contributing to regret-prone consumption behaviors. These results extend the scope of regret and cognitive dissonance research beyond isolated decision episodes by emphasizing regret frequency as a persistent consumer outcome. From a managerial standpoint, the findings suggest that retailers can alleviate regret-driven dissatisfaction by enhancing decision support, minimizing choice overload, and developing post-purchase reassurance strategies tailored to segments prone to regret..\n📄 Download PDF\nPrivacyBench: A Conversational Benchmark for Evaluating Privacy in Personalized AI Authors: Srija Mukhopadhyay, Sathwik Reddy, Shruthi Muthukumar, Jisun An, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru Venue: arXiv (2025)\nPersonalized AI agents rely on access to a user’s digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.\n📄 Download PDF\nWhen Does the Silhouette Score Work? A Comprehensive Study in Network Clustering Authors: Zongyue Teng, Jun Yan, Dandan Liu, Panpan Zhang Venue: arXiv (2025)\nSelecting the number of communities is a fundamental challenge in network clustering. The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of the silhouette score across unweighted, weighted, and fully connected networks, examining how network size, separation strength, and community size imbalance influence its performance. Simulation studies show that the silhouette score accurately identifies the true number of communities when clusters are well separated and balanced, but it tends to underestimate under strong imbalance or weak separation and to overestimate in sparse networks. Extending the evaluation to a real airline reachability network, we demonstrate that the silhouette-based clustering can recover geographically interpretable and market-oriented clusters. These findings provide empirical guidance for applying the silhouette score in network clustering and clarify the conditions under which its use is most reliable.\n📄 Download PDF\nExplaining Why Things Go Where They Go: Interpretable Constructs of Human Organizational Preferences Authors: Emmanuel Fashae, Michael Burke, Leimin Tian, Lingheng Meng, Pamela Carreno-Medrano Venue: arXiv (2025)\nRobotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.\n📄 Download PDF\n","wordCount":"22900","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-04T15:23:50.536198Z","dateModified":"2026-01-04T15:23:50.536198Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gary"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://garyforreal.me/en/posts/paper/paper-2026-01-04-weekly/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Gary's House","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://garyforreal.me/img/Q.jpg"}}}</script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aplayer/dist/APlayer.min.css><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aplayer/dist/APlayer.min.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/meting@2/dist/Meting.min.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/ accesskey=h title="Gary's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://garyforreal.me/img/me.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>Gary's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/zh/ title=中文 aria-label=中文>中文</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/search title="🔍Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>🔍Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/ title=🏠Homepage><span>🏠Homepage</span></a></li><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/posts title=📚Article><span>📚Article</span></a></li><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/archives/ title=⏱Archives><span>⏱Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/music/ title=🎵music><span>🎵music</span></a></li><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/about title=🙋🏻‍♂️About><span>🙋🏻‍♂️About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/posts/paper/>Paper</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Weekly Paper Notes - 2026-01-04</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2026-01-04 15:23:50.536198 +0000 UTC'>2026-01-04</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;108 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;108 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Gary&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://garyforreal.me/zh/posts/paper/paper-2026-01-04-weekly/>中文</a></li></ul><div class=meta-item>&nbsp·&nbsp

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24842v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=practising-responsibility-ethics-in-nlp-as-a-hands-on-coursehttpsarxivorgabs251224825v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24825v1>Practising responsibility: Ethics in NLP as a hands-on course</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#practising-responsibility-ethics-in-nlp-as-a-hands-on-coursehttpsarxivorgabs251224825v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Malvina Nissim, Viviana Patti, Beatrice Savoldi

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Detecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24772v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=chat-driven-optimal-management-for-virtual-network-serviceshttpsarxivorgabs251224614v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24614v1>Chat-Driven Optimal Management for Virtual Network Services</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chat-driven-optimal-management-for-virtual-network-serviceshttpsarxivorgabs251224614v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuya Miyaoka, Masaki Inoue, Kengo Urata, Shigeaki Harada
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24614v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=safe-in-the-future-dangerous-in-the-past-dissecting-temporal-and-linguistic-vulnerabilities-in-llmshttpsarxivorgabs251224556v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24556v1>Safe in the Future, Dangerous in the Past: Dissecting Temporal and Linguistic Vulnerabilities in LLMs</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#safe-in-the-future-dangerous-in-the-past-dissecting-temporal-and-linguistic-vulnerabilities-in-llmshttpsarxivorgabs251224556v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Abdullahi Said, Muhammad Sammani Sani
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24556v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=finmmdocr-benchmarking-financial-multimodal-reasoning-with-scenario-awareness-document-understanding-and-multi-step-computationhttpsarxivorgabs251224903v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24903v1>FinMMDocR: Benchmarking Financial Multimodal Reasoning with Scenario Awareness, Document Understanding, and Multi-Step Computation</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#finmmdocr-benchmarking-financial-multimodal-reasoning-with-scenario-awareness-document-understanding-and-multi-step-computationhttpsarxivorgabs251224903v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zichen Tang, Haihong E, Rongjin Li, Jiacheng Liu, Linwei Jia, Zhuodi Hao, Zhongjun Yang, Yuanze Li, Haolin Tian, Xinyi Hu, Peizhi Zhao, Yuan Liu, Zhengyu Wang, Xianghe Wang, Yiling Huang, Xueyuan Lin, Ruofei Bai, Zijian Xie, Qian Huang, Ruining Cao, Haocheng Gao

The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>The real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to streamline real estate transactions, strengthen stakeholder trust, and enable scalable, secure digital processes.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24457v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=automating-the-analysis-of-parsing-algorithms-and-other-dynamic-programshttpsarxivorgabs251223665v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23665v1>Automating the Analysis of Parsing Algorithms (and other Dynamic Programs)</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#automating-the-analysis-of-parsing-algorithms-and-other-dynamic-programshttpsarxivorgabs251223665v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell, Jason Eisner

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.23799v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=understanding-efl-learners-code-switching-and-teachers-pedagogical-approaches-in-llm-supported-speaking-practicehttpsarxivorgabs251223136v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23136v1>Understanding EFL Learners&rsquo; Code-Switching and Teachers&rsquo; Pedagogical Approaches in LLM-Supported Speaking Practice</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-efl-learners-code-switching-and-teachers-pedagogical-approaches-in-llm-supported-speaking-practicehttpsarxivorgabs251223136v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyeong Park, Jieun Han, Yeon Su Park, Youngbin Lee, Suin Kim, Juho Kim, Alice Oh, So-Yeon Ahn
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>For English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, code-switching (CSW), or alternating between their native language and the target language (English), can lower anxiety and ease communication barriers. Large language models (LLMs), with their multilingual abilities, offer new opportunities to support CSW in speaking practice. Yet, the pedagogical design of LLM-based tutors remains underexplored. To this end, we conducted a six-week study of LLM-mediated speaking practice with 20 Korean EFL learners, alongside a qualitative study with nine English teachers who designed and refined responses to learner CSW. Findings show that learners used CSW not only to bridge lexical gaps but also to express cultural and emotional nuance, prompting teachers to employ selective interventions and dynamic scaffolding strategies. We conclude with design implications for bilingual LLM-powered tutors that leverage teachers&rsquo; expertise to transform CSW into meaningful learning opportunities.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.23136v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=tabibert-a-large-scale-modernbert-foundation-model-and-unified-benchmarking-framework-for-turkishhttpsarxivorgabs251223065v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23065v1>TabiBERT: A Large-Scale ModernBERT Foundation Model and Unified Benchmarking Framework for Turkish</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tabibert-a-large-scale-modernbert-foundation-model-and-unified-benchmarking-framework-for-turkishhttpsarxivorgabs251223065v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melikşah Türker, A.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.23065v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=scaling-open-ended-reasoning-to-predict-the-futurehttpsarxivorgabs251225070v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25070v1>Scaling Open-Ended Reasoning to Predict the Future</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#scaling-open-ended-reasoning-to-predict-the-futurehttpsarxivorgabs251225070v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil Chandak, Shashwat Goel, Ameya Prabhu, Moritz Hardt, Jonas Geiping

In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.
We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics &ndash; specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed &ndash; using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.
We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25065v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=many-minds-from-one-model-bayesian-transformers-for-population-intelligencehttpsarxivorgabs251225063v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063v1>Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#many-minds-from-one-model-bayesian-transformers-for-population-intelligencehttpsarxivorgabs251225063v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diji Yang, Yi Zhang
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25063v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=context-aware-llm-based-ai-agents-for-human-centered-energy-management-systems-in-smart-buildingshttpsarxivorgabs251225055v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25055v1>Context-aware LLM-based AI Agents for Human-centered Energy Management Systems in Smart Buildings</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#context-aware-llm-based-ai-agents-for-human-centered-energy-management-systems-in-smart-buildingshttpsarxivorgabs251225055v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianzhi He, Farrokh Jazizadeh
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype&rsquo;s performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25055v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=adagresadaptive-greedy-context-selection-via-redundancy-aware-scoring-for-token-budgeted-raghttpsarxivorgabs251225052v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25052v1>AdaGReS:Adaptive Greedy Context Selection via Redundancy-Aware Scoring for Token-Budgeted RAG</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#adagresadaptive-greedy-context-selection-via-redundancy-aware-scoring-for-token-budgeted-raghttpsarxivorgabs251225052v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Peng, Bin Wang, Zhilei Long, Jinfang Sheng
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25052v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=modeling-language-as-a-sequence-of-thoughtshttpsarxivorgabs251225026v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026v1>Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#modeling-language-as-a-sequence-of-thoughtshttpsarxivorgabs251225026v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nasim Borazjanizadeh, James McClelland
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level &ldquo;thought&rdquo; states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG&rsquo;s loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25026v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=efx-orientations-a-parameterized-complexity-perspectivehttpsarxivorgabs251225033v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25033v1>EF(X) Orientations: A Parameterized Complexity Perspective</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#efx-orientations-a-parameterized-complexity-perspectivehttpsarxivorgabs251225033v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sotiris Kanellopoulos, Edouard Nemery, Christos Pergaminelis, Minas Marios Sotiriou, Manolis Vasilakis

In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25033v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=strengthening-dual-bounds-for-multicommodity-capacitated-network-design-with-unsplittable-flow-constraintshttpsarxivorgabs251225018v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25018v1>Strengthening Dual Bounds for Multicommodity Capacitated Network Design with Unsplittable Flow Constraints</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#strengthening-dual-bounds-for-multicommodity-capacitated-network-design-with-unsplittable-flow-constraintshttpsarxivorgabs251225018v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lacy M.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Multicommodity capacitated network design (MCND) models can be used to optimize the consolidation of shipments within e-commerce fulfillment networks. In practice, fulfillment networks require that shipments with the same origin and destination follow the same transfer path. This unsplittable flow requirement complicates the MCND problem, requiring integer programming (IP) formulations in which binary variables replace continuous flow variables. To enhance the solvability of this variant of the MCND problem for large-scale logistics networks, this work focuses on strengthening dual bounds. We investigate the polyhedra of arc-set relaxations, and we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities that can be implemented within solution approaches. We develop one approach that dynamically adds valid inequalities to the root node of a reformulation of the MCND IP with additional valid metric inequalities. We show the effectiveness of our ideas with a comprehensive computational study using path-based fulfillment instances, constructed from data provided by a large U.S.-based e-commerce company, and the well-known arc-based Canad instances. Experiments show that our best solution approach for a practical path-based model reduces the IP gap by an average of 26.5% and 22.5% for the two largest instance groups, compared to solving the reformulation alone, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the dual bound. In addition, experiments using only the arc-based relaxation highlight the strength of our new valid inequalities relative to the linear programming relaxation (LPR), yielding an IP-gap reduction of more than 85%.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25018v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=attribution-guided-distillation-of-matryoshka-sparse-autoencodershttpsarxivorgabs251224975v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24975v1>Attribution-Guided Distillation of Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#attribution-guided-distillation-of-matryoshka-sparse-autoencodershttpsarxivorgabs251224975v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cristina P.

In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature&rsquo;s contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24975v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=high-performance-quantum-interconnect-between-bosonic-modules-beyond-transmission-loss-constraintshttpsarxivorgabs251224926v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24926v1>High-performance quantum interconnect between bosonic modules beyond transmission loss constraints</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#high-performance-quantum-interconnect-between-bosonic-modules-beyond-transmission-loss-constraintshttpsarxivorgabs251224926v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongwei Huang, Jie Zhou, Weizhou Cai, Weiting Wang, Yilong Zhou, Yunlai Zhu, Ziyue Hua, Yifang Xu, Lida Sun, Juan Song, Tang Su, Ming Li, Haifeng Yu, Chang-Ling Zou, Luyan Sun

To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability.

Retrieving atmospheric states from these observations constitutes a high-dimensional, ill-posed inverse problem, particularly under cloudy-sky conditions where multiple-scattering effects are present. In this work, we develop a data-driven, physics-aware inversion framework for FORUM all-sky retrievals based on latent twins: coupled autoencoders for atmospheric states and spectra, combined with bidirectional latent-space mappings. A lightweight model-consistency correction ensures physically plausible cloud variable reconstructions. The resulting framework demonstrates potential for retrievals of atmospheric, cloud and surface variables, providing information that can serve as a prior, initial guess, or surrogate for computationally expensive full-physics inversion methods. It also enables robust scene classification and near-instantaneous inference, making it suitable for operational near-real-time applications.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25071v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=from-inpainting-to-editing-a-self-bootstrapping-framework-for-context-rich-visual-dubbinghttpsarxivorgabs251225066v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25066v1>From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#from-inpainting-to-editing-a-self-bootstrapping-framework-for-context-rich-visual-dubbinghttpsarxivorgabs251225066v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu He, Haoxian Zhang, Hejia Chen, Changyuan Zheng, Liyang Chen, Songlin Tang, Jiehui Huang, Xiaoqiang Liu, Pengfei Wan, Zhiyong Wu

In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25066v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=computational-analysis-of-disease-progression-in-pediatric-pulmonary-arterial-hypertensionhttpsarxivorgabs251225027v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25027v1>Computational Analysis of Disease Progression in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#computational-analysis-of-disease-progression-in-pediatric-pulmonary-arterial-hypertensionhttpsarxivorgabs251225027v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Said, Christopher Tossas-Betancourt, Mary K.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25027v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=no-vision-no-wearables-5g-based-2d-human-pose-recognition-with-integrated-sensing-and-communicationshttpsarxivorgabs251224923v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24923v1>No Vision, No Wearables: 5G-based 2D Human Pose Recognition with Integrated Sensing and Communications</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no-vision-no-wearables-5g-based-2d-human-pose-recognition-with-integrated-sensing-and-communicationshttpsarxivorgabs251224923v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haojin Li, Dongzhe Li, Anbang Zhang, Wenqi Zhang, Chen Sun, Haijun Zhang
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>With the increasing maturity of contactless human pose recognition (HPR) technology, indoor interactive applications have raised higher demands for natural, controller-free interaction methods. However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24923v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=beda-belief-estimation-as-probabilistic-constraints-for-performing-strategic-dialogue-actshttpsarxivorgabs251224885v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24885v1>BEDA: Belief Estimation as Probabilistic Constraints for Performing Strategic Dialogue Acts</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beda-belief-estimation-as-probabilistic-constraints-for-performing-strategic-dialogue-actshttpsarxivorgabs251224885v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hengli Li, Zhaoxin Yu, Qi Shen, Chenxi Li, Mengmeng Wang, Tinglang Wu, Yipeng Kang, Yuxuan Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24885v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=description-of-baryon-mass-spectrum-by-open-strings-and-diquarkshttpsarxivorgabs251224882v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24882v1>Description of Baryon Mass Spectrum by Open Strings and Diquarks</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#description-of-baryon-mass-spectrum-by-open-strings-and-diquarkshttpsarxivorgabs251224882v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Fujimoto
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We analyze the mass spectra of hadrons and demonstrate that the physical spectra of mesons and baryons are well described by the exponential spectrum of open strings. The open string spectrum, derived from string theory, is characterized by a unique Hagedorn temperature $T_{\rm H}$ and free from any other parameters. Notably, our fitting to the physical spectra yields consistent values for both mesons and baryons, $T_{\rm H} \simeq 0.34,\text{GeV}$, which contrasts with previous phenomenological analyses that suggested different values. This obtained value aligns well with typical string tension derived from lattice-QCD calculations and the Regge slope. In the baryonic sector, our results indicate that diquarks play a crucial role in describing the mass spectrum, implying that baryons can be understood as a quark-diquark system, as anticipated by Regge phenomenology. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of quark deconfinement, especially in the possibly existing regime at high temperature and small baryon chemical potential within the QCD phase diagram.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24882v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=bi-c2r-bidirectional-continual-compatible-representation-for-re-indexing-free-lifelong-person-re-identificationhttpsarxivorgabs251225000v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25000v1>Bi-C2R: Bidirectional Continual Compatible Representation for Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bi-c2r-bidirectional-continual-compatible-representation-for-re-indexing-free-lifelong-person-re-identificationhttpsarxivorgabs251225000v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Cui, Jiahuan Zhou, Yuxin Peng
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as &ldquo;re-indexing&rdquo;. However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25000v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=noise-resilient-real-time-phase-imaging-via-undetected-lighthttpsarxivorgabs251224993v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24993v1>Noise resilient real-time phase imaging via undetected light</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#noise-resilient-real-time-phase-imaging-via-undetected-lighthttpsarxivorgabs251224993v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josué R.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Quantum imaging with undetected light has recently emerged as a technique in which quantum correlations and nonlinear interferometry are combined to decouple illumination and detection paths. This approach has been more recently extended and combined with digital phase-shifting holography and off-axis holography to extract both the amplitude and phase information of a sample relying on single-photon interference. Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where the observed system is subject to environmental noise and dynamic variations remains challenging. The primary limitation lies in the inability of quantum imaging systems to retrieve object information in real time under high-noise conditions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate real-time amplitude and phase imaging in noisy environments, building upon our previous implementation of quantum off-axis holography. Our results demonstrate real-time imaging at acquisition rates up to 4~Hz, even when the noise level exceeds the signal by an order of magnitude.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24993v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=geqie-framework-for-rapid-quantum-image-encodinghttpsarxivorgabs251224973v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24973v1>GEQIE Framework for Rapid Quantum Image Encoding</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#geqie-framework-for-rapid-quantum-image-encodinghttpsarxivorgabs251224973v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafał Potempa, Michał Kordasz, Józef P.

RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video&rsquo;s motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Randomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25074v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=gamo-geometry-aware-multi-view-diffusion-outpainting-for-sparse-view-3d-reconstructionhttpsarxivorgabs251225073v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25073v1>GaMO: Geometry-aware Multi-view Diffusion Outpainting for Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gamo-geometry-aware-multi-view-diffusion-outpainting-for-sparse-view-3d-reconstructionhttpsarxivorgabs251225073v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Chuan Huang, Hao-Jen Chien, Chin-Yang Lin, Ying-Huan Chen, Yu-Lun Liu
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Microstructured surfaces are central to photonics, biointerfaces, and functional coatings, yet they are typically fabricated through multi-step lithographic workflows requiring masks or molds and post-processing. Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25048v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=responserank-data-efficient-reward-modeling-through-preference-strength-learninghttpsarxivorgabs251225023v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25023v1>ResponseRank: Data-Efficient Reward Modeling through Preference Strength Learning</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#responserank-data-efficient-reward-modeling-through-preference-strength-learninghttpsarxivorgabs251225023v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Kaufmann, Yannick Metz, Daniel Keim, Eyke Hüllermeier
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25023v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=strong-gravitational-lensing-by-a-black-hole-with-a-global-monopole-in-kalb-ramond-bumblebee-gravityhttpsarxivorgabs251224995v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24995v1>Strong Gravitational Lensing by a Black Hole with a Global Monopole in Kalb-Ramond Bumblebee Gravity</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#strong-gravitational-lensing-by-a-black-hole-with-a-global-monopole-in-kalb-ramond-bumblebee-gravityhttpsarxivorgabs251224995v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bijendra Kumar Vishvakarma, Shubham Kala

The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections. These findings demonstrate that FRB 20201124A exhibits closely spaced, patchy, multi-frequency emission with frequency-dependent activity, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of repeating FRBs.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24978v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=fundamental-limits-for-near-field-sensing----part-ii-wide-band-systemshttpsarxivorgabs251224962v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24962v1>Fundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing &ndash; Part II: Wide-Band Systems</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fundamental-limits-for-near-field-sensing----part-ii-wide-band-systemshttpsarxivorgabs251224962v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Wei, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Bhavani Shankar M.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) envisioned for 6G enable high-resolution sensing. However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian&ndash;Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram&rsquo;er&ndash;Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24958v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=simulations-of-two-dimensional-single-mode-rayleigh-taylor-instability-using-front-trackingghost-fluid-method-comparison-to-experiments-and-theoryhttpsarxivorgabs251224949v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24949v1>Simulations of two-dimensional single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability using front-tracking/ghost-fluid method: comparison to experiments and theory</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#simulations-of-two-dimensional-single-mode-rayleigh-taylor-instability-using-front-trackingghost-fluid-method-comparison-to-experiments-and-theoryhttpsarxivorgabs251224949v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Burton, Tulin Kaman

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25034v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=approximations-for-the-weighted-reversal-transposition-and-indel-distance-problem-with-intergenic-region-informationhttpsarxivorgabs251225016v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25016v1>Approximations for the Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance Problem with Intergenic Region Information</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#approximations-for-the-weighted-reversal-transposition-and-indel-distance-problem-with-intergenic-region-informationhttpsarxivorgabs251225016v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Siqueira, Alexsandro Oliveira Alexandrino, Zanoni Dias

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>The complexity, interdependence, and rapid evolution of 3GPP specifications present fundamental challenges for ensuring the security of modern cellular networks. Manual reviews and existing automated approaches, which often depend on rule-based parsing or small sets of manually crafted security requirements, fail to capture deep semantic dependencies, cross-sentence/clause relationships, and evolving specification behaviors. In this work, we present CellSecInspector, an automated framework for security analysis of 3GPP specifications. CellSecInspector extracts structured state-condition-action (SCA) representations, models mobile network procedures with comprehensive function chains, systematically validates them against 9 foundational security properties under 4 adversarial scenarios, and automatically generates test cases. This end-to-end pipeline enables the automated discovery of vulnerabilities without relying on manually predefined security requirements or rules. Applying CellSecInspector to the well-studied 5G and 4G NAS and RRC specifications, it discovers 43 vulnerabilities, 8 of which are previously unreported. Our findings show that CellSecInspector is a scalable, adaptive, and effective solution to assess 3GPP specifications for safeguarding operational and next-generation cellular networks.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24682v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=effects-of-algorithmic-visibility-on-conspiracy-communities-reddit-after-epsteins-suicidehttpsarxivorgabs251224351v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24351v1>Effects of Algorithmic Visibility on Conspiracy Communities: Reddit after Epstein&rsquo;s &lsquo;Suicide&rsquo;</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#effects-of-algorithmic-visibility-on-conspiracy-communities-reddit-after-epsteins-suicidehttpsarxivorgabs251224351v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asja Attanasio, Francesco Corso, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Francesco Pierri
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>This paper examines how algorithmic visibility shapes a large conspiracy community on Reddit after Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s death.
We ask whether homepage exposure changes who join r/conspiracy, how long they stay, and how they adapt linguistically, compared with users who arrive through organic discovery.
Using a computational framework that combines toxicity scores, survival analysis, and lexical and semantic measures, the study shows that homepage visibility acts as a selection mechanism rather than a simple amplifier.
Users who discover the community organically integrate more quickly into its linguistic and thematic norms and show more stable engagement over time.
By contrast, users who arrive through visibility on the homepage remain semantically distant from core discourse and participate more briefly.
Overall, algorithmic visibility reshapes audience size, community composition, and linguistic cohesion:
newcomers who do not join organically have different incentives, integrate weakly, and leave quickly, which limits organic growth.
In this high-risk setting, the observed behavioral and linguistic trajectories over five months do not match standard narratives in which incidental exposure to conspiracy content produces durable radicalization.
These findings can inform the design of web platforms and recommendation systems that seek to curb harmful conspiracy exposure while supporting more responsible, transparent, and socially beneficial uses of algorithmic recommendations.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24351v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=enhancing-llm-based-neural-network-generation-few-shot-prompting-and-efficient-validation-for-automated-architecture-designhttpsarxivorgabs251224120v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24120v1>Enhancing LLM-Based Neural Network Generation: Few-Shot Prompting and Efficient Validation for Automated Architecture Design</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#enhancing-llm-based-neural-network-generation-few-shot-prompting-and-efficient-validation-for-automated-architecture-designhttpsarxivorgabs251224120v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chandini Vysyaraju, Raghuvir Duvvuri, Avi Goyal, Dmitry Ignatov, Radu Timofte
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24120v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=explaining-news-bias-detection-a-comparative-shap-analysis-of-transformer-model-decision-mechanismshttpsarxivorgabs251223835v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23835v1>Explaining News Bias Detection: A Comparative SHAP Analysis of Transformer Model Decision Mechanisms</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#explaining-news-bias-detection-a-comparative-shap-analysis-of-transformer-model-decision-mechanismshttpsarxivorgabs251223835v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himel Ghosh
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.23835v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=amplitude-constraints-on-dark-energyhttpsarxivorgabs251225047v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25047v1>Amplitude constraints on dark energy</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#amplitude-constraints-on-dark-energyhttpsarxivorgabs251225047v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Scott Melville

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_β\to \ell_α+ X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25019v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=semiclassics-branes-and-extremalityhttpsarxivorgabs251224979v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24979v1>Semiclassics, branes, and extremality</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#semiclassics-branes-and-extremalityhttpsarxivorgabs251224979v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adolfo Holguin

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) &ndash; an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 &ndash; poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24966v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=matrix-thermodynamic-uncertainty-relation-for-non-abelian-charge-transporthttpsarxivorgabs251224956v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24956v1>Matrix Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Non-Abelian Charge Transport</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#matrix-thermodynamic-uncertainty-relation-for-non-abelian-charge-transporthttpsarxivorgabs251224956v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domingos S.

Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets &ndash; to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25068v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=feeling-blue-constructing-a-robust-salt3-uv-template-and-constraining-its-redshift-dependencyhttpsarxivorgabs251225064v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25064v1>Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#feeling-blue-constructing-a-robust-salt3-uv-template-and-constraining-its-redshift-dependencyhttpsarxivorgabs251225064v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinan Wang, David O.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical&ndash;UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\mathring{\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\gtrsim0.2$. We demonstrate that, if confirmed, such evolution could lead to a few-percent bias in the measurement of $w$ if high-$z$ rest-frame UV data are included in future cosmological surveys such as LSST and $\textit{Roman}$.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25064v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=extreme-nonlinear-optics-in-optical-fibershttpsarxivorgabs251225046v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25046v1>Extreme nonlinear optics in optical fibers</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#extreme-nonlinear-optics-in-optical-fibershttpsarxivorgabs251225046v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario Ferraro, Bertrand Kibler, Pierre Béjot, Frédéric Gérome, Benoit Debord, Fetah Benabid, Fabio Mangini, Stefan Wabnitz

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Many regularization priors for Bayesian regression assume the regression coefficients are a priori independent. In particular this is the case for standard Bayesian treatments of the lasso and the elastic net. While independence may be reasonable in some data-analytic settings, incorporating dependence in these prior distributions provides greater modeling flexibility. This paper introduces the orthant normal distribution in its general form and shows how it can be used to structure prior dependence in the Bayesian elastic net regression model. An L1-regularized version of Zellner&rsquo;s g prior is introduced as a special case, creating a new link between the literature on penalized optimization and an important class of regression priors. Computation is challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant in the prior. We avoid this issue by modifying slightly a standard prior of convenience for the hyperparameters in such a way to enable simple and fast Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution. The benefit of including structured prior dependence in the Bayesian elastic net regression model is demonstrated through simulation and a near-infrared spectroscopy data example.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25045v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=primordial-black-hole-dark-matter-from-ultra-slow-roll-inflation-in-horndeski-gravityhttpsarxivorgabs251225044v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25044v1>Primordial black hole dark matter from ultra-slow-roll inflation in Horndeski gravity</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#primordial-black-hole-dark-matter-from-ultra-slow-roll-inflation-in-horndeski-gravityhttpsarxivorgabs251225044v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Despina Totolou, Theodoros Papanikolaou, Emmanuel N.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16}),M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25044v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=discovering-coordinated-joint-options-via-inter-agent-relative-dynamicshttpsarxivorgabs251224827v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24827v1>Discovering Coordinated Joint Options via Inter-Agent Relative Dynamics</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discovering-coordinated-joint-options-via-inter-agent-relative-dynamicshttpsarxivorgabs251224827v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raul D.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24827v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=multi-modal-cross-domain-mixed-fusion-model-with-dual-disentanglement-for-fault-diagnosis-under-unseen-working-conditionshttpsarxivorgabs251224679v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24679v1>Multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis under unseen working conditions</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#multi-modal-cross-domain-mixed-fusion-model-with-dual-disentanglement-for-fault-diagnosis-under-unseen-working-conditionshttpsarxivorgabs251224679v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengcheng Xia, Yixiang Huang, Chengjin Qin, Chengliang Liu
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Identifying the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors plays an essential role in the ongoing quest to understand correlated electronic matter. A long-standing approach is to study the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $λ$ for evidence of nodal points where the superconducting gap vanishes. However, experimental reports can be ambiguous due to the requisite low-temperature resolution, and the similarity in signatures of nodal quasiparticles and impurity states. Here we study the pairing symmetry of Weyl semimetal $T_d$-MoTe$_2$, where previous measurements of $λ$ have yielded conflicting results. We utilize a novel technique based on a microwave resontor to measure the kinetic inductance of MoTe$_2$, which is directly related to $λ$. The high precision of this technique allows us to observe power-law temperature dependence of $λ$, and to measure the anomalous nonlinear Meissner effect &ndash; the current dependence of $λ$ arising from nodal quasiparticles.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We resolve the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture for mean curvature flows in all dimensions and for all types of cylindrical singularities. Specifically, we show that if the tangent flow at a singular point is a multiplicity-one cylinder, then in a neighborhood of that point the flow is mean-convex, its time-slices arise as level sets of a continuous function, and all nearby tangent flows are cylindrical. Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description.
Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds&rsquo;&rsquo; argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Materials in which electrons occupy interstitial sites as anions are called electrides and exhibit unusual dimensionality-dependent electronic behavior. These properties make electrides attractive for catalysis, transparent conductors, and emergent quantum phenomena, yet their theoretical treatment remains challenging. In conventional materials, the ground-state atomic structure dictates the electronic configuration, whereas in electrides the electronic structure can instead govern the atomic arrangement. Here, the performance of commonly used exchange-correlation functionals is evaluated for representative one-, two-, and three-dimensional electrides. The results show that higher-cost approaches do not necessarily perform better across all cases, while standard methods capture the qualitative electride character and many key energetic and structural trends with surprising reliability. This behavior, likely arising from fortuitous error cancellation, supports the reliability of legacy studies in the field and the viability of efficient high-throughput exploration using low-cost methods. Overall, the findings support a tiered computational strategy for electride modelling, integrating system-specific heuristics with efficient first-principles screening. This approach balances computational feasibility with physical fidelity and underscores the continuing leadership of theory in the predictive discovery of electride materials across dimensionalities.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24989v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=the-radon--nikodym-topography-of-acyclic-measured-graphshttpsarxivorgabs251224741v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24741v1>The Radon&ndash;Nikodym topography of acyclic measured graphs</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-radon--nikodym-topography-of-acyclic-measured-graphshttpsarxivorgabs251224741v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anush Tserunyan, Robin Tucker-Drob
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We study locally countable acyclic measure-class-preserving (mcp) Borel graphs by analyzing their &ldquo;topography&rdquo; &ndash; the interaction between the geometry and the associated Radon&ndash;Nikodym cocycle. We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure.
At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended.
Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon&ndash;Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24741v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=fundamental-limits-for-weighted-empirical-approximations-of-tilted-distributionshttpsarxivorgabs251223979v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23979v1>Fundamental limits for weighted empirical approximations of tilted distributions</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fundamental-limits-for-weighted-empirical-approximations-of-tilted-distributionshttpsarxivorgabs251223979v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarvesh Ravichandran Iyer, Himadri Mandal, Dhruman Gupta, Rushil Gupta, Agniv Bandhyopadhyay, Achal Bassamboo, Varun Gupta, Sandeep Juneja

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Broad applications of quantum computers will require error correction (EC). However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.
We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.23810v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=an-exceptional-set-of-uniformly-spread-kakutani-tilings-of-the-linehttpsarxivorgabs251223079v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23079v1>An exceptional set of uniformly spread Kakutani tilings of the line</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#an-exceptional-set-of-uniformly-spread-kakutani-tilings-of-the-linehttpsarxivorgabs251223079v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yotam Smilansky

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a &ldquo;render and wait&rdquo; paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24986v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=symseqbench-a-unified-framework-for-the-generation-and-analysis-of-rule-based-symbolic-sequences-and-datasetshttpsarxivorgabs251224977v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24977v1>SymSeqBench: a unified framework for the generation and analysis of rule-based symbolic sequences and datasets</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#symseqbench-a-unified-framework-for-the-generation-and-analysis-of-rule-based-symbolic-sequences-and-datasetshttpsarxivorgabs251224977v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barna Zajzon, Younes Bouhadjar, Maxime Fabre, Felix Schmidt, Noah Ostendorf, Emre Neftci, Abigail Morrison, Renato Duarte
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers&rsquo; websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news &ldquo;slop.&rdquo; Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24968v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=mama-memeia-multi-aspect-multi-agent-collaboration-for-depressive-symptoms-identification-in-memeshttpsarxivorgabs251225015v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25015v1>MAMA-Memeia!

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We introduce a Modewise Additive Factor Model (MAFM) for matrix-valued time series that captures row-specific and column-specific latent effects through an additive structure, offering greater flexibility than multiplicative frameworks such as Tucker and CP factor models. In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing.

Parity symmetry is spontaneously broken in the model, which helps in solving the strong CP problem without the axion. The Higgs sector of the model is very simple, consisting of a single pair of $H_L(2,1,4)+ H_R(1,2,4)$ fields. Fermion masses arise through mixing of the chiral fermions with vector-like quarks and leptons contained in $(1,1,15)$ as well as $(1,1,10)_L+(1,1,10)_R$ multiplets via a universal seesaw mechanism. Consistency of such a spectrum with the observed quark and lepton masses is established. The parity solution to the strong CP problem is shown to be effective in this framework, although there are new loop contributions to $\overlineθ$, compared to the analogous left-right symmetric model, arising from color sextet and octet fermions, as well as from diagrams mediated by leptoquark bosons. We also find that, in this setup, although lepton number is broken, neutrino masses remain zero at the tree-level.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We develop a general effective field theory (EFT) framework for neutrino-dark matter (DM) interactions, and apply it to systematically find all possible gauge-invariant ultraviolet (UV) completions at a given EFT operator dimension. Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrino-DM scattering in a low-energy effective theory with neutrinos and DM (DM-LEFT), together with its gauge-invariant embedding in the Standard Model EFT (DM-SMEFT). We then construct all renormalizable tree-level UV completions that generate the relevant DM-SMEFT operators up to dimension-8 using a topology-based classification. Using this framework, we present minimal UV-complete models for different DM types that can yield effective neutrino-DM couplings up to several orders of magnitude larger than the Fermi coupling, while satisfying all constraints, most notably from neutrino mass and from the charged-lepton sector. This includes a pseudo-Dirac fermion DM realization in the scotogenic neutrino mass model and models of Majorana DM inspired by type-II and inverse seesaw-based neutrino mass models. Phenomenological implications for DM thermal relic abundance and direct detection prospects, as well as various cosmological and laboratory constraints on the model parameter space, are also analyzed.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25035v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h2 id=-neuroscience>🔍 neuroscience<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-neuroscience>#</a></h2><h3 id=securing-high-concurrency-ticket-sales-a-framework-based-on-microservicehttpsarxivorgabs251224941v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24941v1>Securing High-Concurrency Ticket Sales: A Framework Based on Microservice</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#securing-high-concurrency-ticket-sales-a-framework-based-on-microservicehttpsarxivorgabs251224941v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyong Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhang, Xiaoqi Li
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the &ldquo;add passenger&rdquo; function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24941v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h2 id=-data_resources>🔍 data_resources<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-data_resources>#</a></h2><h3 id=r-debater-retrieval-augmented-debate-generation-through-argumentative-memoryhttpsarxivorgabs251224684v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24684v1>R-Debater: Retrieval-Augmented Debate Generation through Argumentative Memory</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#r-debater-retrieval-augmented-debate-generation-through-argumentative-memoryhttpsarxivorgabs251224684v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maoyuan Li, Zhongsheng Wang, Haoyuan Li, Jiamou Liu
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24684v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=youtu-llm-unlocking-the-native-agentic-potential-for-lightweight-large-language-modelshttpsarxivorgabs251224618v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24618v1>Youtu-LLM: Unlocking the Native Agentic Potential for Lightweight Large Language Models</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#youtu-llm-unlocking-the-native-agentic-potential-for-lightweight-large-language-modelshttpsarxivorgabs251224618v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junru Lu, Jiarui Qin, Lingfeng Qiao, Yinghui Li, Xinyi Dai, Bo Ke, Jianfeng He, Ruizhi Qiao, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Yunsheng Wu, Yinsong Liu, Shuangyin Liu, Mingkong Tang, Haodong Lin, Jiayi Kuang, Fanxu Meng, Xiaojuan Tang, Yunjia Xi, Junjie Huang, Haotong Yang, Zhenyi Shen, Yangning Li, Qianwen Zhang, Yifei Yu, Siyu An, Junnan Dong, Qiufeng Wang, Jie Wang, Keyu Chen, Wei Wen, Taian Guo, Zhifeng Shen, Daohai Yu, Jiahao Li, Ke Li, Zongyi Li, Xiaoyu Tan
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled &ldquo;Commonsense-STEM-Agent&rdquo; Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24618v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=efficiently-estimating-data-efficiency-for-language-model-fine-tuninghttpsarxivorgabs251224991v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24991v1>Efficiently Estimating Data Efficiency for Language Model Fine-tuning</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#efficiently-estimating-data-efficiency-for-language-model-fine-tuninghttpsarxivorgabs251224991v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gyung Hyun Je, Colin Raffel
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task&rsquo;s data efficiency&ndash;i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance&ndash;is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task&rsquo;s data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task&rsquo;s data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24922v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h2 id=-emotion_language>🔍 emotion_language<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-emotion_language>#</a></h2><h3 id=classification-of-interacting-topological-crystalline-superconductors-in-three-dimensions-and-beyondhttpsarxivorgabs251225069v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25069v1>Classification of Interacting Topological Crystalline Superconductors in Three Dimensions and Beyond</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#classification-of-interacting-topological-crystalline-superconductors-in-three-dimensions-and-beyondhttpsarxivorgabs251225069v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shang-Qiang Ning, Xing-Yu Ren, Qing-Rui Wang, Yang Qi, Zheng-Cheng Gu
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Although classification for free-fermion topological superconductors (TSC) is established, systematically understanding the classification of 3D interacting TSCs remains difficult, especially those protected by crystalline symmetries like the 230 space groups. We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones. We explicitly obtain formulas for all three layers of decoration $(n_2, n_3, ν_4)$, which are amenable to automatic computation. As an application, we classify the 230 space-group topological crystalline superconductors in interacting electronic systems.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25069v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=classifying-long-legal-documents-using-short-random-chunkshttpsarxivorgabs251224997v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24997v1>Classifying long legal documents using short random chunks</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#classifying-long-legal-documents-using-short-random-chunkshttpsarxivorgabs251224997v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Adrián Cabrera-Diego

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We consider classification problems for manifolds and discrete subgroups of Lie groups from a descriptive set-theoretic point of view. This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $=<em>{\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan&ndash;Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck&ndash;Zimmer and Andretta&ndash;Camerlo&ndash;Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth&ndash;Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=</em>{\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24996v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=sequential-bayesian-parameter-state-estimation-in-dynamical-systems-with-noisy-and-incomplete-observations-via-a-variational-frameworkhttpsarxivorgabs251225056v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25056v1>Sequential Bayesian parameter-state estimation in dynamical systems with noisy and incomplete observations via a variational framework</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sequential-bayesian-parameter-state-estimation-in-dynamical-systems-with-noisy-and-incomplete-observations-via-a-variational-frameworkhttpsarxivorgabs251225056v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liliang Wang, Alex Gorodetsky
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Online joint estimation of unknown parameters and states in a dynamical system with uncertainty quantification is crucial in many applications. For example, digital twins dynamically update their knowledge of model parameters and states to support prediction and decision-making. Reliability and computational speed are vital for DTs. Online parameter-state estimation ensures computational efficiency, while uncertainty quantification is essential for making reliable predictions and decisions. In parameter-state estimation, the joint distribution of the state and model parameters conditioned on the data, termed the joint posterior, provides accurate uncertainty quantification. Because the joint posterior is generally intractable to compute, this paper presents an online variational inference framework to compute its approximation at each time step. The approximation is factorized into a marginal distribution over the model parameters and a state distribution conditioned on the parameters. This factorization enables recursive updates through a two-stage procedure: first, the parameter posterior is approximated via variational inference; second, the state distribution conditioned on the parameters is computed using Gaussian filtering based on the estimated parameter posterior. The algorithmic design is supported by a theorem establishing upper bounds on the joint posterior approximation error. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method (i) matches the performance of the joint particle filter in low-dimensional problems, accurately inferring both unobserved states and unknown parameters of dynamical and observation models; (ii) remains robust under noisy, partial observations and model discrepancies in a chaotic Lorenz 96 system; and (iii) scales effectively to a high-dimensional convection-diffusion system, where it outperforms the joint ensemble Kalman filter.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25056v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=the-pde-odi-principle-and-cylindrical-mean-curvature-flowshttpsarxivorgabs251225050v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25050v1>The PDE-ODI principle and cylindrical mean curvature flows</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-pde-odi-principle-and-cylindrical-mean-curvature-flowshttpsarxivorgabs251225050v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard H.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \emph{PDE&ndash;ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.
As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>We present a systematic characterization of the fractal conduction pathways governing ionic transport in a non-crystalline solid below the glass-transition temperature. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations of lithium metasilicate, we combine mobility-resolved dynamical analysis with a real-space description of the regions explored by lithium ions. Ensemble-averaged velocity autocorrelation functions rapidly decorrelate and do not resolve the pronounced dynamic heterogeneity of the system, whereas single-ion analysis reveals short-lived episodes of nearly collinear motion. By mapping active-site clusters over increasing time windows, we show that ion-conducting pathways are quasi one-dimensional at short times and evolve into larger, branched structures characterized by a robust fractal dimension $d_f\simeq1.7$. This geometry persists while the silicate backbone remains structurally arrested, whereas near the glass-transition temperature the loss of structural memory leads to the reappearance of small clusters. These results provide a real-space structural interpretation of ionic transport in non-crystalline solids and support fractal pathway models of high-frequency ionic response.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25031v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=detector-response-matrices-effective-areas-and-flash-effective-areas-for-radiation-detectorshttpsarxivorgabs251225021v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25021v1>Detector Response Matrices, Effective Areas, and Flash-Effective Areas for Radiation Detectors</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#detector-response-matrices-effective-areas-and-flash-effective-areas-for-radiation-detectorshttpsarxivorgabs251225021v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Bowers, Eve Chase, William Ford, Daniel Coupland, Brian Larsen, Caleb Roecker, Karl Smith, Kurtis Bartlett, Katherine Gattiker Katherine Mesick

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25004v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=laser-intracavity-absorption-magnetometry-for-optical-quantum-sensinghttpsarxivorgabs251224951v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24951v1>Laser intracavity absorption magnetometry for optical quantum sensing</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#laser-intracavity-absorption-magnetometry-for-optical-quantum-sensinghttpsarxivorgabs251224951v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> J.

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Intracavity absorption spectroscopy (ICAS) is a well-established technique for detecting weak absorption signals with ultrahigh sensitivity. Here, we extend this concept to magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We introduce laser intracavity absorption magnetometry (LICAM), a concept that is in principle applicable to a broader class of optical quantum sensors, including optically pumped magnetometers. Using an electrically driven, edge-emitting diode laser that operates self-sustainably, we show that LICAM enables highly sensitive magnetometers operating under ambient conditions. Near the lasing threshold, we achieve a 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and a 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity compared with a conventional single-pass geometry. The experimental results are accurately described by a rate-equation model for single-mode diode lasers. From our measurements, we determine a projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity in the $\mathrm{pT},\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ range and show that, with realistic device improvements, sensitivities down to the $\mathrm{fT},\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ scale are attainable.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24951v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=compound-estimation-for-binomialshttpsarxivorgabs251225042v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25042v1>Compound Estimation for Binomials</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#compound-estimation-for-binomialshttpsarxivorgabs251225042v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Chen, Lihua Lei
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Many applications involve estimating the mean of multiple binomial outcomes as a common problem &ndash; assessing intergenerational mobility of census tracts, estimating prevalence of infectious diseases across countries, and measuring click-through rates for different demographic groups. The most standard approach is to report the plain average of each outcome. Despite simplicity, the estimates are noisy when the sample sizes or mean parameters are small. In contrast, the Empirical Bayes (EB) methods are able to boost the average accuracy by borrowing information across tasks. Nevertheless, the EB methods require a Bayesian model where the parameters are sampled from a prior distribution which, unlike the commonly-studied Gaussian case, is unidentified due to discreteness of binomial measurements. Even if the prior distribution is known, the computation is difficult when the sample sizes are heterogeneous as there is no simple joint conjugate prior for the sample size and mean parameter.
In this paper, we consider the compound decision framework which treats the sample size and mean parameters as fixed quantities. We develop an approximate Stein&rsquo;s Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) for the average mean squared error given any class of estimators. For a class of machine learning-assisted linear shrinkage estimators, we establish asymptotic optimality, regret bounds, and valid inference. Unlike existing work, we work with the binomials directly without resorting to Gaussian approximations. This allows us to work with small sample sizes and/or mean parameters in both one-sample and two-sample settings. We demonstrate our approach using three datasets on firm discrimination, education outcomes, and innovation rates.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.25042v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=geometric-characterisation-of-structural-and-regular-equivalences-in-undirected-hypergraphshttpsarxivorgabs251224961v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24961v1>Geometric characterisation of structural and regular equivalences in undirected (hyper)graphs</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#geometric-characterisation-of-structural-and-regular-equivalences-in-undirected-hypergraphshttpsarxivorgabs251224961v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marzieh Eidi, Nina Otter
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Similarity notions between vertices in a graph, such as structural and regular equivalence, are one of the main ingredients in clustering tools in complex network science. We generalise structural and regular equivalences for undirected hypergraphs and provide a characterisation of structural and regular equivalences of undirected graphs and hypergraphs through neighbourhood graphs and Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Our characterisation sheds new light on these similarity notions opening a new avenue for their exploration. These characterisations also enable the construction of a possibly wide family of regular partitions, thereby offering a new route to a task that has so far been computationally challenging.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24961v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=antecedents-of-consumer-regret-frequency-the-roles-of-decision-agency-status-signaling-and-online-shopping-preferencehttpsarxivorgabs251224862v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24862v1>Antecedents of Consumer Regret Frequency: The Roles of Decision Agency, Status Signaling, and Online Shopping Preference</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#antecedents-of-consumer-regret-frequency-the-roles-of-decision-agency-status-signaling-and-online-shopping-preferencehttpsarxivorgabs251224862v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shawn Berry
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Consumer regret is a widespread post-purchase emotion that significantly impacts satisfaction, product returns, complaint behavior, and customer loyalty. Despite its prevalence, there is a limited understanding of why certain consumers experience regret more frequently as a chronic aspect of their engagement in the marketplace. This study explores the antecedents of consumer regret frequency by integrating decision agency, status signaling motivations, and online shopping preferences into a cohesive framework. By analyzing survey data (n=338), we assess whether consumers&rsquo; perceived agency and decision-making orientation correlate with the frequency of regret, and whether tendencies towards status-related consumption and preferences for online shopping environments exacerbate regret through mechanisms such as increased social comparison, expanded choice sets, and continuous exposure to alternative offers. The findings reveal that regret frequency is significantly linked to individual differences in decision-related orientations and status signaling, with a preference for online shopping further contributing to regret-prone consumption behaviors. These results extend the scope of regret and cognitive dissonance research beyond isolated decision episodes by emphasizing regret frequency as a persistent consumer outcome. From a managerial standpoint, the findings suggest that retailers can alleviate regret-driven dissatisfaction by enhancing decision support, minimizing choice overload, and developing post-purchase reassurance strategies tailored to segments prone to regret..</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24862v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=privacybench-a-conversational-benchmark-for-evaluating-privacy-in-personalized-aihttpsarxivorgabs251224848v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24848v1>PrivacyBench: A Conversational Benchmark for Evaluating Privacy in Personalized AI</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#privacybench-a-conversational-benchmark-for-evaluating-privacy-in-personalized-aihttpsarxivorgabs251224848v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srija Mukhopadhyay, Sathwik Reddy, Shruthi Muthukumar, Jisun An, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user&rsquo;s digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24848v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=when-does-the-silhouette-score-work-a-comprehensive-study-in-network-clusteringhttpsarxivorgabs251224841v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24841v1>When Does the Silhouette Score Work?

<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Selecting the number of communities is a fundamental challenge in network clustering. The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of the silhouette score across unweighted, weighted, and fully connected networks, examining how network size, separation strength, and community size imbalance influence its performance. Simulation studies show that the silhouette score accurately identifies the true number of communities when clusters are well separated and balanced, but it tends to underestimate under strong imbalance or weak separation and to overestimate in sparse networks. Extending the evaluation to a real airline reachability network, we demonstrate that the silhouette-based clustering can recover geographically interpretable and market-oriented clusters. These findings provide empirical guidance for applying the silhouette score in network clustering and clarify the conditions under which its use is most reliable.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24841v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr><h3 id=explaining-why-things-go-where-they-go-interpretable-constructs-of-human-organizational-preferenceshttpsarxivorgabs251224829v1><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24829v1>Explaining Why Things Go Where They Go: Interpretable Constructs of Human Organizational Preferences</a><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#explaining-why-things-go-where-they-go-interpretable-constructs-of-human-organizational-preferenceshttpsarxivorgabs251224829v1>#</a></h3><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel Fashae, Michael Burke, Leimin Tian, Lingheng Meng, Pamela Carreno-Medrano
<strong>Venue:</strong> arXiv (2025)</p><p>Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.</p><p><a href="https://papersdb.wangyilin-0429.workers.dev/api/pdf?pid=2512.24829v1">📄 Download PDF</a></p><hr></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer><div><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h style=font-size:20px>Comments</span><hr></div><div id=tcomment></div><script src=https://cdn.staticfile.org/twikoo/1.6.39/twikoo.all.min.js></script><script>twikoo.init({envId:"https://mangodb-theta.vercel.app/",el:"#tcomment",lang:"en-US",path:window.TWIKOO_MAGIC_PATH||window.location.pathname})</script></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://garyforreal.me/en/>Gary's House</a></span> ·
